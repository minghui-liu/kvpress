This information is only known at the procedure's definition, which may not be encountered before its invocation.

This allows the compiler to know the parameter's usage before its full definition, enabling code generation without the need for a messy fixup mechanism or multiple passes through the source code.", "Michigan had a successful start to their Big Ten Conference season, winning multiple games against top-ranked opponents. They achieved their first four conference wins since 2002-2003 and defeated three consecutive top-10 opponents for the first time since 1986-1987. Notably, they ended an 11-game losing streak against Wisconsin at the Kohl Center and secured consecutive road wins against top-five opponents. Michigan's star player, Nik Stauskas, had standout performances throughout this period, earning multiple Player of the Week honors. Overall, Michigan had a 10-game winning streak and a 7-0 start in the Big Ten, tying their best record since 1976-1977."], "answers": ["Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 4"], "context": "Paragraph 1: For the invocation of a procedure (or function) with parameters, their type will be known (they being declared before use) but their usage in the procedure invocation may not be. Fortran for example passes all parameters by reference (i.e. by address) so there is no immediate difficulty with generating the code (as always, with actual addresses to be fixed up later), but Pascal and other languages allow parameters to be passed by different methods at the programmer's choice (by reference, or by value, or even perhaps by \"name\") and this is signified only in the definition of the procedure, which is unknown before the definition has been encountered. Specifically for Pascal, in the specification of parameters a prefix \"Var\" signifies that it must be received by reference, its absence signifies by value. In the first case the compiler must generate code that passes the address of the parameter, while in the second it must generate different code that passes a copy of the value, usually via a stack. As always, a \"fixup\" mechanism could be invoked to deal with this, but it would be very messy. Multi-pass compilers can of course collate all the required information as they shuttle back and forth, but single-pass compilers cannot. Code generation could be paused while the scan advances (and its results be held in internal storage) until such time as the needed entity is encountered, and this might not be regarded as resulting in a second pass through the source because the code generation stage will soon catch up, it was merely halting for a while. But this would be complex. Instead a special construction is introduced, whereby the procedure's definition of parameter usage is declared \"forward\" of its later full definition so that the compiler may know it before use, as it requires.\n\nParagraph 2: On his route to becoming a better man, Sipowicz struggles to overcome his bigotry with the help of his partner Bobby Simone, he and Fancy continue to have beefs but always resolve them. He also eventually comes to terms with his homophobia, mainly due to his initially grudging friendship with precinct Police Administrative Assistant John Irvin. With the birth of his second son, Sipowicz's life seems to be going well. However, a series of devastating personal tragedies over the next few years arise: in May 1996, Andy Jr., who is about to start work as a policeman in Hackensack, New Jersey, is shot and killed while trying to stop a robbery. The shooting sends Andy Sr. into an alcoholic relapse, during which Sylvia briefly throws him out of the house. In November 1998, Bobby Simone dies of an infection caused by heart transplant complications, and less than a year later in May 1999, Sylvia is accidentally killed by the distraught father of PAA Dolores Mayo (whose killer she had been prosecuting)  outside the courtroom. This is then followed by the disappearance and subsequent murder of Simone's successor Danny Sorenson during an undercover assignment in 2001. He also survives a serious bout with prostate cancer in 1998. With the exception of Andy Jr.'s death, however, Sipowicz remains sober in the face of all of these tragedies. He also has to deal with the fact that he had been instrumental in putting an innocent black man in prison for 18 years for the murder of a teenager, remembering that he had no experience as a detective and deferred to a lazy veteran cop. He is the only cop to apologize when the man is released (he learns that the perpetrator was a white man who later died of a drug overdose, and while Sipowicz and the now-retired veteran cop basically knew he'd been murdered, the end result of the case was left unresolved).\n\nParagraph 3: With the decline removal of the Banu Qasi, the sons of Muhammad al-Tawil jockeyed for control over several of the coras of the Upper March, but amidst internecine struggles, rebellions and their own failure to maintain popular support, they were progressively marginalized. Abd al-Malik ibn Muhammad al-Tawil had succeeded his father at Huesca and installed his brother Amrus at Monzón, though the latter soon lost it to the Banu Qasi. Abd al-Malik's hold on Huesca was challenged by a series of rebellions by Banu Shabrit cousins, whom he killed, only to himself be killed and supplanted by his brother Amrus in 918. However, the Huesca citizenry rejected Amrus in favor of his brother Fortun ibn Muhammad al-Tawil.  Amrus fled to Barbastro and Alquézar, and was later offered Lleida by its residents, only for them to turn the city over to Muhammad ibn Lubb al-Qasawi in 922. He was captured by the Banu Tujib in 932, submitted to Abd al-Rahman III, and was killed participating in the Caliph's 934/5 campaign against Zaragoza and its rebel Banu Tujib lords. Fortun ibn Muhammad al-Tawil had submitted to Abd al-Rahman at the same time as Amrus, but in 933 he was expelled from Huesca after forming a pact with rebel Muhammad ibn Hasim al-Tujibi and replaced by his brother Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Tawil, and though Fortun went to Córdoba and abased himself before the Caliph, begging to be restored, Abd al-Rahman instead sent an outsider, Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Ilyas of Valencia, and the sons of Fortun and Yahya left the Upper March for Córdoba. However, after Ahmed struggled to retain control against the rebel Banu Tujib, Abd al-Rahman restored Fortun to Huesca in 936/7 against the will of the city's residents. When Fortun accompanied the Caliph on a campaign against León, he turned control of Huesca over to his brother Musa, who in 940 was formally named as wali of Huesca and Barbastro, though the latter was given to his brother Yahya in 942, to be followed by another brother, Lubb ibn Muhammad in 951, and Lubb's son Yahya in 955. In 957/8, the Caliph experimented with power sharing, making Yahya ibn Lubb and Abd al-Malik ibn Musa, who had succeeded his father in Huesca in 954, joint rulers of both Huesca and Barbastro, but he again segregated their control of the two coras in 959.  By this time the Banu al-Tawil had long since lost their ability to mount a credible challenge for the control of the Upper March against the new dominant family, the Banu Tujib, and the last of the Banu al-Tawil is seen fighting in a tournament in Córdoba in 974.\n\nParagraph 4: In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota, Michigan won its fifth consecutive game against Minnesota and its fifth consecutive game at the Williams Arena. After winning two games by a combined 50 points last year, Michigan beat Northwestern 74–51 to mark its sixth straight victory over the Wildcats. The team gave Nebraska its first loss in the new Pinnacle Bank Arena on January 9, its first five-game win streak since the 2013 NCAA tournament. By beating Penn State on January 14, Michigan won its first four conference games for the first time since the 2002–03 team won its first six games. In the game Stauskas had a game-high 21 points, a team-high five assists and six rebounds. On January 18 Michigan defeated (#3 AP, #3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998–99 team won on February 27, 1999 against the 1998–99 Badgers, ending an 11-game losing streak at Wisconsin. It was the highest-ranked team to lose to Michigan on the road, surpassing a victory over #5 Duke on  December 5, 1964 by the Cazzie Russell-led 1964–65 team. After the win, Michigan returned to the national polls (#21, #T25). On January 21 Stauskas was the Big Ten Conference Player of the Week for the first time, leading the conference in scoring and 20-point games. On January 22 Michigan defeated (#10, #10) Iowa, matching the 6–0 start of the 2002–03 team and the Wolverines' first defeat of consecutive top-10 opponents since the 1996–97 team defeated #10 Duke and #6 Arizona. It was the first time Michigan defeated consecutive top-10 opponents in consecutive games since the 1992–93 team defeated #5 North Carolina and #2 Kansas in December 1992. Stauskas tied his career high of 26 points, with five rebounds and five assists. On January 25, ESPN's College GameDay covered the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry game. With Michigan State on an 11-game winning streak (including seven in conference) and Michigan on an eight-game winning streak (including six in conference), the game was the first time in Big Ten history that two teams met who were 6–0 or better in conference play. Michigan defeated the (#3, #3) Spartans 80–75, with Stauskas and Walton contributing 19 points apiece. It was the first time in school history that the team defeated three consecutive AP Poll top-10 opponents, and the first time since the 2006–07 Florida Gators that any team—and the first time since the 1986–87 Iowa Hawkeyes that a Big Ten team—won three consecutive games against top-10 opponents. It gave the team consecutive road wins against top-five opponents after a 36-game losing streak against them. Michigan's 7–0 Big Ten start was its best since the 1976–77 Wolverines won their first eight games. Stauskas was the Big Ten and CBS Sports National Player of the Week, and Walton was the Big Ten Freshman of the Week on January 27. Stauskas was also named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) on January 28. Michigan extended its winning streak to 10 games, tying its 1976–77 8–0 Big Ten start by beating Purdue. Caris LeVert had his first double-double, with a career-high 11 rebounds.\n\nParagraph 5: The Quincy Railway was commenced under the following circumstances: The 'Bunker Hill Monument Association' had been formed, and funds enough collected to commence the foundation of the monument in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty-five. I aided the architect in preparing the foundation, and on the seventeenth day of June following, the corner-stone was laid by General de La Fayette, and I had the honor to assist as master builder at the ceremony. I had, previous to this, purchased a stone quarry (the funds being furnished by Dr. John C. Warren) for the express purpose of procuring the granite for constructing this monument. This quarry was in Quincy, nearly four miles from water-carriage. This suggested to me the idea of a railroad (the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad being in contemplation at that time, but was not begun until the spring following); accordingly, in the fall of eighteen hundred and twenty-five, I consulted Thomas H. Perkins, William Sullivan, Amos Lawrence, Isaac T. Davis, and David Moody, all of Boston, in reference to it. These gentlemen thought the project visionary and chimerical, but, being anxious to aid the Bunker Hill Monument, consented that I might see what could be done. I awaited the meeting of our Legislature in the winter of eighteen hundred and twenty-five and six, and after every delay and obstruction that could be thrown in the way, I finally obtained a charter, although there was great opposition in the House. The questions were asked: 'What do we know about rail-roads? Who ever heard of such a thing? Is it right to take people's land for a project that no one knows anything about? We have corporations enough already.' Such and similar objections were made, and onerous restrictions were imposed, but it finally passed by a small majority only. Unfavorable as the charter was, it was admitted that it was obtained by my exertions; but it was owing to the munificence and public spirit of Colonel T. H. Perkins that we were indebted for the whole enterprise. None of the first named gentlemen ever paid any assessments, and the whole stock finally fell into the hands of Colonel Perkins.\n\nParagraph 6: Gibbs released a Vicor Music single called \"Miss\" in 1988 which became a radio hit. His second album entitled \"Ipagpatawad\" received a Gold and Platinum Award. One of the singles from that album with the same title won the 1991 Awit Award for Best Revival. Poly Cosmic Records released his third and fourth album. The third, entitled \"Bulong\" contains two of his original compositions. It also contained a revival entitled \"Binibini\" and the much loved \"I Believe in Dreams\". His fourth album \"Another Chance\", carries the hit song \"Pinakamagandang Babae\" which he himself composed, plus the moving love song \"Another Chance\". His album \"Sa ‘Yo\" was again released through Viva Records where it had received a Gold Record Award.In 2001,Viva Records released an all revival album Divas & I which contains duet with the divas. In 2002, Viva Records released a live album called Janno Live Viva's and I. In 2004, Gibbs was now also a recording artist of GMA Records when he released his album entitled \"Seven\", as it is also his seventh album. Viva Records had a compilation album called \"Janno Silver Series\" which contained duets with Pops Fernandez, Jaya, Regine Velasquez, Rachel Alejandro and Ogie Alcasid. In 2007, Gibbs created an album called \"Little Boy\" which contained seven of his original composition. In 2008, Gibbs created a new album entitled \"Orig\" where 11 songs are composed and produced by himself. In 2010, Gibbs created another compilation album called \"The Janno Gibbs Anthology\" in which 18 of the songs are his compositions. In 2015, Gibbs created another album called \"Novela\" which contains the telenovela theme songs of GMA. In 2016, Gibbs created a single for his birthday titled \"Get It On\". In 2017, Gibbs records and created his latest single under GMA Records titled \"My Jagiya\" also a theme song of GMA's Telenovela Series \"My Korean Jagiya\". In 2017, Gibbs releases his new album this year very soon under GMA Records. In January 2018, Gibbs released a new digital album called Nagbabalik which includes his single Get It On, Oh Girl featuring Andrew E. and many more under GMA Records available on Spotify and other digital stores nationwide. In 2021, Gibbs releases his two new singles under Viva Records titled Pangmalakasan and Pag-Ibig Kong Tunay. In 2022, Gibbs releases his single under Viva Records on his birthday titled Future Lover.\n\nParagraph 7: Fan Hanjie was born in Dabu, Guangdong. He spent his formative years at Zili College, a college his father was a founding member. In 1911, he was admitted to Guangdong Army Institute, majoring in astronomy; in 1913 after graduating he joined the military service in the Guangdong Section, as an officer of the survey bureau, in Dongjiang and the Chaoshan area. In 1920 he was transferred to the Department of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, fighting local pirates and repress smuggling activities, and then he was promoted to the rank of captain on the Jiangping Warship. In 1923 he was again transferred to the Department of the General Staff, and promoted to the rank of colonel. In May 1924, the Whampoa Military Academy was founded in Canton, When Fan Hanjie was almost 30 years of age, and he was hesitated to enroll first, due to his mature age, most student cadets were in their early twenties. Because the successful outcome of the first KMT-CPC cooperation, Fan Hanjie had high hopes for the national revolution and he took the entrance exams and was easily admitted, is the only student who held the rank of colonel in the entire academy. After graduation from the academy, Fan Hanjie like other graduates, starting from scratch, in the army platoon, company, battalion duties to participate in the suppression of Chen Jiongming's revolt against the Nationalist Government during the Second Eastern Campaign. In the summer 1926, the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, and was Fan's first actual combat experience; he has been selected as commander of the 10th Regiment of the 29th Division, and was one of the first regiment commanders from the Whampoa academy. Fan led the troops to participate in the famous battle at the Ting Kau Bridge. In October the same year he was promoted to first deputy commander of 10th division. November 1927, during the KMT- CCP split, Chen mingshu, commander of the 1st Army, and 10th Division Commander Jiang Guang Nai defected to Chiang Kai-shek; Fan Hanjie also would be leaving to go to Nanjing. By Chiang Kai-sheik's orders, he was sent to the Zhejiang province as the garrison commander, as a Whampoa graduate of first class, and in August, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down, Zhejiang Guard division was abolished and Fan Hanjie was transferred to the NRA General Headquarters of the 8th Route Army . Soon Chiang Kai-shek returned to power, and sent Fan Hanjie to Japan to study the political and military strategies then he went to Germany, and studied in German military training school until the outbreak of the Manchurian incident on September 18, 1931.\n\nParagraph 8: Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke ( Sidney, 27 October 1561 – 25 September 1621) was among the first Englishwomen to gain notice for her poetry and her literary patronage. By the age of 39, she was listed with her brother Philip Sidney and with Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare among the notable authors of the day in John Bodenham's verse miscellany Belvidere. Her play Antonius is widely seen as reviving interest in soliloquy based on classical models and as a likely source of Samuel Daniel's closet drama Cleopatra (1594) and of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra (1607). She was also known for translating Petrarch's \"Triumph of Death\", for the poetry anthology Triumphs, and above all for a lyrical, metrical translation of the Psalms.\n\nParagraph 9: SQLstream provides a relational stream processing platform called SQLstream Blaze for analyzing large volumes of service, sensor and machine and log file data in real-time. It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data.  Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard SQL language, using the ANSI standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional RDBMS SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored.  Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement.  For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer.  This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution.   SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications.  This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application.  Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules.  In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data.  SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally.  Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.  SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free.  This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.\n\nParagraph 10: After his return to Cassel and his marriage, as well as the death of his eldest son, Pfeiffer had grown unhappy with his medical practice, finding the state of medical science at the time insufficient for his intellectual needs, and gave it up to focus on scientific studies and literary works, particularly in the fields of botany and conchology. His first scientific work, published in 1837, was a book cataloging and describing the various cactus species used in German gardens. It was well received, and as a result, he became known as \"Kaktus-Pfeiffer.\" In 1839, Pfeiffer was sent to Cuba with Johannes Gundlach and Eduard Otto in order to study the flora, fauna, and natural history of the West Indies, and it was this experience that piqued his interest in mollusks, conchology, and malacology. he group explored other islands in the Caribbean, but the experience had to come to and end, as the extended absence from home, which coincided with the deaths of his two remaining children, caused a rift between Pfeiffer and his wife that led to their divorce almost immediately upon his return to Europe in 1841. After remarrying, Pfeiffer adopted a sedentary and academic lifestyle, focusing his energy on the specimens and data he had collected in Cuba, classifying more than 20 new genera and species of mollusks. He proved to be a prolific publisher, and expanded his interest from conchology to the botany that had been his first love, writing several treatises on the nature flora of Hesse and its surrounding regions, coedited with the esteemed botanist Johann Cassebeer. Since 1836, Pfeiffer had been a member of the Cassel Society for Natural history, and from 1837 a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Regensburg Botanical Society. In 1868, Pfeiffer and his colleagues Wilhelm Kobelt and Karl Ludwig Fridolin von Sandberger added a further membership with the founding of the German Malacozoological Society. In 1871, Pfeiffer's already failing health was dealt a blow with the death of his youngest son Wilhelm, only 19 years old, on the battlefield in France, one of innumerable casualties of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1874, the increasingly frail Louis Pfeiffer undertook a two month journey to Catalonia, where his eldest son Hermann was in business as a merchant, and the trip appears to have been an uneventful one, despite conceding directly with the coup d'etat that toppled the First Spanish Republic. In 1875, on the 50th anniversary of his doctorate, and the 70th anniversary of his birth, he was surprised by the medical faculty of the University of Marburg, who renewed his doctoral credentials. In addition to the renewal of his medical doctorate, he was also given an honorary doctorate in philosophy by the philosophy faculty, honoring a life spent in pursuit of knowledge. Pfeiffer was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle, 4th class, in gratitude for scientific service to the nation."}

When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his long-time companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \"blocked\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles – Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced – Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1992, In My Life, Lamond's sophomore album was released, bolstered by the lead single, \"Where Does That Leave Love\", which quickly charted high. The album contained a solid mix of freestyle and pop along with a couple ballads, all intended to further build his name within mainstream music. However, national pop radio, at the time, was going thru a seismic shift, with a heavy R&B influence. By the Spring, 1993 release of the album's third and final single, \"I Want You Back\", a remake of the Jackson 5 classic featuring a then-relatively unknown Marc Anthony on backing vocals, Lamond was no longer a priority as far as promotion, and he would subsequently be dropped from Columbia Records.\n\nParagraph 3: Scalzi also uses the Whatever to help raise money for organizations and causes he supports. Notably, in June 2007 he raised over $5000 in 6 days for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State after fellow writer Joe Hill challenged him to go visit the Creation Museum that had just opened near Cincinnati, not far from Scalzi's Ohio home, if Hill paid for the ticket, offering to match the cost with a donation to the charity of Scalzi's choice after he filed a comprehensive report on the trip online. Scalzi extended the deal to all Whatever readers, raised 256 times the admission price, and posted his critical report on the Creation Museum on November 12, 2007. In September 2010 he joined with Subterranean Press and authors Wil Wheaton, Patrick Rothfuss, Catherynne M. Valente, Rachel Swirsky and others to create a chapbook story collection called Clash of the Geeks, offered online in exchange for donations to the Michigan/Indiana affiliate of the Lupus Alliance of America. Some of the stories were selected from a competition run on Whatever to write a story to explain a painting Scalzi had commissioned from Jeff Zugale, that featured Scalzi as an orc and Wheaton riding a unicorn pegasus kitten.\n\nParagraph 4: Magnetotactic crystals range anywhere in size from 30 nanometers to 120 nanometers. This size allows them to be magnetically stable and to help optimize the MTB ability toward magnetotaxis. The single domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. A smaller size would not be as efficient to contribute to the cellular magnetic moment, the smaller size crystals are superparamagnetic, therefore they are not continuously magnetic. Crystals exceeding 120 nanometers can form magnetic domains in opposition to the desired direction. While a single magnetosome chain could appear to be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. A reported example includes large magnetosomes (up to 200 nanometers) found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells contain enough magnetosomes that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but the magnetosomes are clustered on one side of the cell. In this arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the magnetosome chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may lead to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes; possibly related to metabolism.\n\nParagraph 5: 158th Brigade returned to the canal on 14 August and spent the next three months at Ferdan. By the end of the year it was back at Romani, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) having cleared Sinai of the enemy. On 20 January 1917 53rd (W) Division began the march across the Sinai Desert, reaching Wadi el Arish at the end of the month. It moved up to Rafah on 21 March. After an approach march beginning on 24 March, the EEF attacked Gaza on 26 March, launching the First Battle of Gaza. 53rd (W) Division in the Desert Column was ordered to cross the Wadi Ghuzze towards Gaza itself, masked by the mounted divisions sweeping round the flank. The division was led by 160th Bde, followed by 158th, 1/5th RFW leading. The battalion's guide got lost and there was an overnight fog, so 158th Bde was late crossing the wadi that morning, but by 06.30 it reached the edge of the Mansura ridge overlooking the plain of Gaza. At 11.30 the division was hurriedly ordered to attack, even though the artillery had not yet established communications. 158th Brigade set out shortly after 11.45 to attack Ali Muntar, with 1/5th RWF leading, preceded by a strong patrol. The whole advance, watched by the mounted divisions, was 'a model in precision and steadiness'. After leaving the protection of Mansura the battalion immediately came under shrapnel fire as it marched across open ground parallel to the Ali Muntar defences before wheeling left and moved down to a small cactus garden about  from the crest of Ali Muntar. Here Lt-Col Borthwick waited for the other battalions to catch up, and firing became general, with the battalion troubled by enemy fire coming in from Green Hill to the left as well as in front. The brigadier reinforced the battalion with machine guns and sent another battalion to take Green Hill. The whole line then advanced again. About 40 men of 1/5th RWF dashed through the machine gun fire and made a lodgement in the trenches east of Ali Muntar mosque, capturing Turks, Austrians and Germans, and held it fast despite enemy counter-attacks. By 18.30 the whole Ali Muntar position was won, and by nightfall Gaza was almost completely surrounded, with patrols from 53rd (W) Division in the eastern streets linking up with the ANZAC Mounted Division. However, the senior British commanders were unaware of the success, and had already ordered the mounted troops to withdraw to water their horses. 53rd (W) Division was ordered to dig in on a line near Wadi Ghuzze next day; isolated at Green Hill, 1/5th RWF also had to fall back. At the end of the day the whole division was withdrawn across the wadi, 158th Bde arriving at 01.15 on 28 March. The battalion's casualties were 2 officers and 33 ORs killed, 9 officers and 186 ORs wounded, and 9 ORs missing.\n\nParagraph 6: The source of the commotion is a group of men pursuing a young woman who is swimming frantically away from the other ship. Templar rescues the woman who, after some considerable hesitation, identifies herself as Loretta Page, a private detective who is investigating the mysterious disappearance of sunken treasure from the Atlantic. When she learns her rescuer is The Saint, she enlists his help in tracking down a group of modern-day pirates. These pirates, led by Kurt Vogel, are using newly developed bathyscape technology to reach the sea floor and scour recent shipwrecks for gold and other booty before officially sanctioned salvage operations arrive. And Vogel is not against committing cold-blooded murder to keep his operation going.\n\nParagraph 7: Amreek resides in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Radha. Both run a movers and packers company called ‘Gently Gently’. Amreek has a laidback and carefree attitude and doesn't believe in owning up to his mistakes. This affects his work and also his relations with Radha. Fed up with his behaviour, Radha breaks up with him. Amreek is devastated. This is when his father, Gurkeerat aka Gurki calls him from his home in Amritsar. He tells Amreek that he should return immediately as his grandmother, Sardar Kaur, is sick. Sardar, aged 90, has a tumour. The doctors advise Gurki that they should take her home as operating her at this age can prove fatal. Gurki realizes Sardar doesn't have much time but he hides this fact from Sardar. Sardar, meanwhile, has a wish. She wants to go to Lahore and visit the house that she built with her husband, late Gursher Singh in 1946. A year later, during Partition, Gursher was stabbed to death while fighting the rioters. Sardar however escaped and reached India. Since then, she has been missing Gursher and the house. Hence, it's her desire to visit Pakistan so that she could see her ancestral house. Sardar tells Amreek about it. Gurki advises Sardar that she can't travel in this condition. But Amreek realizes how much this means to her. He promises her that he'll help fulfil her wish. He tries to get her visa. However, her application is rejected as she's blacklisted from visiting Pakistan. This is because a few years ago, she had attacked a Pakistani official, Saqlain Niazi when she had gone to watch an India vs Pakistan cricket match in Mohali. This is when Amreek learns that Radha has transplanted a nearly hundred-year-old tree in the United States. Amreek thus begins to learn about structural relocation and realizes that a lot of people have successfully lifted a house and transplanted it to a different location. Amreek requests help from both the government of India and Pakistan for his mission. Both decide to help him, in principle. Amreek then decides to visit Lahore. However, he hides about his plan from Sardar. He fears that if he fails in his endeavour, she'll be heartbroken. Hence, Amreek pretends to go back to Los Angeles in front of Sardar. Amreek reaches Lahore and successfully is able to find Sardar's house. But when he reaches there, he sees that the local authorities are about to demolish the structure. But he stops it and manages to convince the mayor (who is actually Saqlain Niazi, the official whom his grandmother had hit in the match)  he brings back the house, thus fulfilling Sardar's wish. In the end of the film, it is revealed that Sardar dies seven years after, and divides the property in three equal shares. It is also revealed that Amreek and Radha marry and move to back to America and have two daughters and son, named after his grandmother.\n\nParagraph 8: Los Angeles, California, is the main and heart-warming scenario where life and fate interconnect five different stories as well as their characters with their respective canine pets: Elizabeth is a famous newscaster of a morning TV show; after a disastrous interview with former football player Jimmy, Elizabeth's boss decides to contract Jimmy as co-host due to the high ratings of the interview. In another part of the city, Tara, a barista at a coffee shop who passes her days talking with her shallow, dog-walker friend Daisy. Tara, who is crazy about the friendly but full of himself vet Dr. Mike, one day meets Garrett, the eccentric and shy owner of an animal care center who is unable to tell Tara that he loves her. Grace and Kurt are a married couple struggling to properly prepare for their adoptive daughter, Amelia, to arrive. When she moves in, she doesn't seem happy with her new home and her new parents. Dax is a teen in the body of adult, and leader of the aspiring rock band Frunk, who after a visit to his pregnant sister Ruth and her husband Greg, is forced to take care of Ruth's dog, despite his building not allowing dogs. Finally Walter, an aging, lonely widower, loses his dog when it escapes and runs off. Tyler, his regular pizza delivery driver unexpectedly offers to help find her. As time moves on, things become more complicated: Elizabeth and Jimmy start to feel attracted to each other, making their work more difficult. After they've been dating for some time, Elizabeth finds out (from her makeup artist) that Jimmy has been offered a position hosting a show on another channel. Tara accepts Garrett’s offer to work as volunteer in his animal care center at the same time she starts to date Dr. Mike; meanwhile Garrett learns that the owner of the building has sold it and he'll lose the center. Amelia finds Walter's dog, which makes her happy, but Grace and Kurt fear that one day Amelia will lose her new friend if the owner appears; Dax is caring for Ruth's dog, although eventually it starts to put order in his life, even as it creates trouble to hide it from his neighbors. Walter begins helping Tyler with his academic studies in exchange for help finding his dog. Jimmy's has to put his dog Brandy down after she suffers a stroke. After hearing the news Elizabeth realizes she loves Jimmy and wants to be with him. Tara works to help Garrett save his animal shelter by organizing a fund-raiser with live music, which culminates in all the main characters' fates intertwining in unexpected ways.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1991, The Monthly Film Bulletin was merged with Sight & Sound, which had until then been published quarterly - Sight & Sound then became a monthly publication and took up The Monthly Film Bulletin'''s remit to review all films released in the UK.The Monthly Film Bulletin was originally published to allow UK cinema managers to decide what films to show, hence the complete cast and production lists, full plot followed by a thorough critique.  Only films that had been registered with the UK government trade authority were covered each month.  During the years of full supporting programmes, The Monthly Film Bulletin printed long lists of B-features and short films with brief capsule reviews; by the 1970s, the tone and style of its reviews had changed considerably, and was increasingly influenced in some cases by the auteur theory and Marxist-influenced film theory, though some more traditional critics such as John Gillett remained, and others such as David McGillivray and Paul Taylor took exploitation movies more seriously than had previously been considered acceptable, while Steve Jenkins wrote a lengthy defence in 1981 of Glen or Glenda.  Another change was that all reviews had a byline - up to September 1968, only the reviews of films considered more significant by the BFI had a partial byline of initials only (so Tom Milne would be \"T.M.\").  From January 1971, all films were listed in alphabetical order, mainly because a new wave of critics who were influencing the magazine had already overturned the assumptions implicit in the separation of films (for example, several by Sergio Leone and many from the stable of Roger Corman were only included in the \"shorter notices\" section).  From the July 1982 issue, The Monthly Film Bulletin changed again to include more feature articles, interviews, and photographs.\n\nParagraph 10: The first step in the transferring process is the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. Thorsness and Fox demonstrated the rate of relocation of mtDNA from mitochondria into the nucleus using ura3- yeast strain with an engineered URA3 plasmid, required gene for uracil biosynthesis, in the mitochondria. During the propagation of such yeast strains carrying a nuclear ura3 mutation, plasmid DNA that escapes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, complements the uracil biosynthetic defect, restoring growth in the absence of uracil, and easily scored phenotype. The rate of DNA transfer from the mitochondria to the nucleus was estimated as 2 x 10-5 per cell per generation while the opposite, in the case of cox2 mutant, the rate of the transfer of plasmid from the nucleus to the mitochondria is apparently at least 100,000 times less. Many factors control the rate of mtDNA escapes from mitochondria to the nucleus. The higher rate of mutation in mtDNA in comparison with nDNA in the cells of many organisms is an important factor promoting the transfer of mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome. One of the intergenic factors results in the higher destruction rate of mitochondrial macromolecules, including mtDNA, is the presence of high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated in mitochondria as the by-products in ATP synthesis mechanism. Some other factors influencing the escape of mtDNA from mitochondria include the action of mutagenic agents and other forms of cellular stress that can damage mitochondria or their membranes, which proves that is possible to assume that exogenous damaging agents (ionizing radiation and chemical genotoxic agents) increase the rate of mtDNA escape into the cytoplasm.  Thorsness and Fox continued their research to find the endogenous factors affecting mtDNA escape into the nucleus. They isolated and studied 21 nuclear mutants with different combinations of mutations in at least 12 nuclear loci called the yme (yeast mitochondrial escape) mutations, in different environmental conditions since some of these mutations cause temperature sensitivity. They found out these mutations which perturb mitochondrial functions, due to the alteration of gene products, affect mitochondrial integrity and led to mtDNA escape to the cytoplasm. Additionally, defects in the proteins change the rate of mtDNA transfer into the nucleus. For instance, in the case of yme1 mutant, abnormal mitochondria are targeted for degradation by the vacuole, with the help of pep4, a major proteinase, and degradation increases mtDNA escape to the nucleus through the process of mitophagy. In addition, Thorsness and Campbell found that by disruption of pep4, the frequency of mtDNA escape in yme1 strains decreases. Similarly, the disruption of PRC1, which encodes carboxypeptidase Y, lowers the rate of mtDNA escape in yme1 yeast."}

An early attempt to understand memory can be found in Aristotle's major treatise, On the Soul, in which he compares the human mind to a blank slate. He theorized that all humans are born free of any knowledge and are the sum of their experiences. It wasn't until the late 1800s, however, that a young German philosopher by the name of Herman Ebbinghaus developed the first scientific approach to studying memory. While some of his findings have endured and remain relevant to this day (Learning Curve), his greatest contribution to the field of memory research was demonstrating that memory can be studied scientifically. In 1972, Endel Tulving proposed the distinction between episodic and semantic memory. This was quickly adopted and is now widely accepted. Following this, in 1985, Daniel Schacter proposed a more general distinction between explicit (declarative) and implicit (procedural) memory With the recent advances in neuroimaging technology, there have been a multitude of findings linking specific brain areas to declarative memory. Despite these advances in Cognitive psychology, there is still much to be discovered in terms of the operating mechanisms of declarative memory. It is unclear whether declarative memory is mediated by a particular memory system or if it is more accurately classified as a type of knowledge and it is not known how or why declarative memory evolved to begin with.\n\nParagraph 2: On July 1, 1977, 96% of Aeroamerica's unionised German flight attendants voted in favour of strike action in a ballot held by the German Salaried Employees' Union. They demanded pay parity with their colleagues working for Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) division and employment contracts governed by local labour law to bring them in line with their unionised counterparts at other Allied airlines that employed their flight attendants locally. The company countered these demands by arguing that the nature of its business required flight attendants to be stationed anywhere, involving frequent postings to overseas stations at short notice to cover global ad hoc and lease commitments. It furthermore argued that adopting other Allied airlines' local employment conditions and pay for its own flight attendants would restrict operational flexibility and increase costs, that this would undermine its ability to compete globally and that the worldwide nature of its operations made all flight attendants' employment conditions subject to American labour law as well as CAB and FAA regulations to comply with US legal requirements. Initially, the airline was able to maintain its full flying programme at the beginning of the busy summer holiday period despite staff not showing up for work, following the first week of unsuccessful negotiations between Aeroamerica's local management and the DAG union. However, the conflict escalated during the second week when the local management dismissed without notice two flight attendants who had picketed a Tegel-bound flight in Brussels. As the conflict was still unresolved by the end of July and threatened to disrupt the holiday plans of thousands of West Berliners during the peak month of August, management attempted to break the flight attendants' strike by temporarily reducing the number of flight attendants from four to three per aircraft as well as by hiring contract labour from an unnamed UK airline. As these developments further aggravated the already tense standoff between the airline and its flight attendants' union, the latter sought to increase pressure on the company to settle the dispute by airing its members' grievances in public. It alleged that Aeroamerica's policy of only complying with minimum FAA requirements resulted in overworking flight attendants, putting lives of crew and passengers at risk in case of an emergency. Despite the negative publicity, management refused to return to the negotiating table and the strike eventually collapsed as the peak summer season drew to a close by the end of August. Following the end of the labour unrest at the company, the FAA subjected Aeroamerica to an unannounced safety audit later the same year. The airline's management alleged that the FAA's move had been prompted by a dismissed flight attendant's act of revenge.\n\nParagraph 3: The embodiment of the Gopher mascot came to life in 1952 when University of Minnesota assistant bandmaster Jerome Glass bought a fuzzy wool gopher suit with a papier-mâché head and asked one of the band members to climb into it.  \"Goldy\" Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1960s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug the little kids, torment the cheerleaders and generally add a friendly Minnesota flavor to the event.\n\nParagraph 4: As a veteran, Henry was interested in the decision that the Mississippi legislature had exempted returning veterans from paying the poll tax. Under the poll tax laws, a person had to have paid his poll tax for two years prior to the time that he voted. Therefore, he tried to get black Mississippians to go down to the courthouse to register to vote. However, several veterans, who were non-white, were unable to register. When Henry went to the circuit clerk's office to register, he was rejected, as had been other black Americans. The clerk asked Henry to bring a certificate showing that he was exempt from the poll tax. Although he brought the certificate, the clerk said that Henry still needed to pass various tests to show that he was qualified to vote. He was finally able to register to vote after he read several sections of the state constitution and went satisfactorily through more tests. Henry used the G.I. Bill, a law that provided educational benefits for World War II veterans, to enroll in the pharmacy school at Xavier University. When he graduated in 1950 with a pharmaceutical degree, he married Noelle Michael and went into his own pharmacy business. As a businessman in Clarksdale, he became involved in local and state activities, particularly events such as African-American voter registration. He decided to organize an NAACP branch in Clarksdale because of the incident where two black girls were raped by two white men who were subsequently judged not guilty. W.A. Higgins, who was the principal of the black high school and already a member of NAACP, made the suggestion, and the NAACP national headquarters encouraged Henry and Higgins to organize a local branch of the NAACP. In 1959, Henry was elected president of the Mississippi organization, and served in the NAACP for decades. Henry became close friends with Medgar Evers, who worked as a secretary for the NAACP in 1950. On June 12, 1963, Evers was assassinated in his driveway in Jackson, Mississippi and his assassination had a great impact on Henry.\n\nParagraph 5: Winrod wrote in his book The Jewish Assault on Christianity, published in 1935 by a publishing company in Topeka, Kansas: \"The same forces which crucified Christ nineteen hundred years ago are today trying to crucify His Church. Many Christian leaders have not yet realized it, but Christianity is in the grip of a life and death struggle at the present time. International Jewish Communism, which has already undermined all nations, firmly expects to exterminate all Christians. What the Cause of Christ has endured in Russia the past eighteen years, surpasses its suffering at the hands of bloody Nero. One of the purposes of the present treatise is to show that this conspiracy is not of recent origin.\" The book was met with positive reception by many Christians at the time. Winrod would go on to say that he believed Jews were damned to hell, and that Jesus Christ condemned them in the Bible. He expanded upon these views, being quoted, \"Will the Church be able to demonstrate sufficient power to triumph over its foes in the present crisis, or has it become so weakened by apostasy and pernicious teachings that it will have to be drenched in its own blood before it can be brought to its senses? Jesus knew better than anyone else the unspeakable crimes of which [the Jews] are capable. The Jesus of the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, is not the quiet, reticent Jesus of modern literature and the fashionable pulpit. The Jesus, whose righteous indignation is here asserted, is a man of words and action, a man in the act of pronouncing eight woes upon the Jewish leaders and finally condemning them to the damnation of hell.\" Winrod spread these views through his newspaper, The Defender, which by 1937 achieved a 100,000 monthly circulation. Some of the articles reproduced materials from the pro-Nazi and virulently antisemitic international Welt-Dienst/World-Service/Service Mondial news agency founded in 1933 by Ulrich Fleischhauer.\n\nParagraph 6: On completion, the CEO of Designbridge, the 16 Clerkenwell Close neighbour contacted the councillor sitting as chairman of Planning Committee B, responsible for all planning approvals within the Clerkenwell Ward receiving more than five public objections. Both neighbour and councillor mistakenly thought the building was constructed without approval, having received planning approval by delegated powers without having to be presented to the Planning Committee of councillors. Without realising the error and already campaigning for election and promotion as chair of all planning committees, the councillor began a press campaign stating, \"it is the ugliest building I have ever seen, being of brutalist concrete, I have given an order for its demolition\". A demolition order was issued during June 2017 and withdrawn the same month on the council receiving copies of full approval notices, drawings for the stone façade and internal department notes and certificates confirming planning and conservation officers and their heads of department had approved and signed off the design and its final details. Still on their election campaign the councillor was informed of the cancellation of the demolition order, maintaining the withdrawal was an error possibly due to a spelling mistake and that it would be reissued. Stating \"the building is not stone and if it is then it cannot be loadbearing and any fossils must have been carved by hand on site and are therefore fake\", when questioned by Richard Waite of the Architects' Journal. February 2018 another demolition order was issued following \"an investigation\" by the same councillor because \"neighbours were unable to see the stone facade as the drawings had not been placed online for the public to see\". On searching both online and original paper files no certificates, drawings, photographs of stone nor internal notes approving the design could be found, only the previously approved brick design option whose drawings were superseded. Additionally, that had approval had been granted for a stone building, the final design differed from the approved design. This order cited the location of the fossils within the stone façade as \"[...] deleterious to the conservation area and listed buildings\" due to their \"haphazard\" placement. When copies of the full approved set of information was sent in again, the head of the Planning Enforcment Department replied that as no information relating to a stone design could now be found within the planning department, the constructed building cannot have planning approval and must therefore be demolished. \n\nParagraph 7: He was educated at Eduardo Mondlane University (Diploma in Development Studies), the University of East Anglia (Diploma in Development Economics, 1991, and MA Industrial Development, 1992), the University of Oxford (MSc Development Economics, 1997) and SOAS, University of London (PhD Economics, 2002).

There are references to \"pleasure boating\" at Oxford in letters and poems written in the late 18th century, but races between crews from different colleges did not start until the early 19th century. Rowing in eights (boats with eight oarsmen, each pulling one oar, and steered by a coxswain) began at Eton, where there is a record of the school owning three eights by 1811, and then progressed to Oxford. The first record of an inter-college race, between eights from Jesus College and Brasenose College, dates from 1815. These may have been the only two colleges who had boats racing at that time, and the Brasenose boat was usually victorious. There were few rowers, and races between fours (boats with four oarsmen and a coxswain) tended to attract more interest than races between eights. Students would row to the inn at Sandford-on-Thames, a few miles south of Oxford, and race each other on the way back. The races would start at Iffley Lock and finish at King's Barge, off Christ Church Meadow. Flags hoisted on the barge would indicate the finishing order of the crews. Crews would set off one behind the other, the trailing boat(s) trying to catch, or \"bump\", the boat ahead. The bumped boat and the bumping boat would then drop out and the bumping boat would start the next day's race ahead of the bumped boat. The aim was to become the lead boat, known as Head of the River. For identification, crews wore college colours and emblazoned the rudder of the boat with the college coat of arms. Crews from Jesus College painted leeks (an emblem of Wales) on their oars for further distinction. In early races, some rowers wore high hats while others, including the Jesus crews, wore Tam o'shanters in college colours (green with a white band for Jesus); crews from Jesus College wore these until at least 1847.\n\nParagraph 9: Danny Rapp (lead), Frank Maffei (2nd tenor), Joe Terranova (baritone) (aka Joe Terry), and Dave White Tricker (first tenor) (aka Dave White) met at John Bartram High School and started singing together in the mid 1950s. Known as the Juvenaires at the time, they sang at school parties and other local events. Local record producer John Madara, took notice of them and introduced them to local DJs Larry Brown and Artie Singer, who had a record label known as Singular Records. In 1957, they recorded a John Madara and Dave White penned song \"Do the Bop\", recording the song as Johnny Madara and The Juvenaires. Singer took it to a fellow DJ named Dick Clark. Clark liked it and suggested changing their name to the Juniors and renaming their song. The song was recorded as \"At The Hop', this time with Danny Rapp on the lead vocal. Changing \"Let's all do the Bop\" to \"Let's go to the Hop\" proved to be successful, and it became a local hit in June 1957. In December 1957, they received a call from Dick Clark to be a last-minute substitution for a no-show band on American Bandstand, and they performed it for a national audience. The song became a nationwide hit after ABC Paramount bought the master recording and issued it in January 1958. They soon appeared on The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom and other national TV shows. Soon after, they recorded  \"Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay\" and \"Dottie\", both of which charted. In the fall of 1957, David began attending Temple University and was on the Gym Team, but quit school when the group started making personal appearances.\n\nParagraph 10: Brigadier-General Michael Tighe arrived too late, just hours after the surrender to support the British at Jassin. Although the British force surrendered, Lettow-Vorbeck realised that the level of German losses of officers and ammunition meant that he could rarely afford confrontation on such a large scale and would need to make use of guerrilla warfare instead—he turned his attention away from seeking decisive battle against the British, concentrating instead on operations against the Uganda Railway. The British response was to withdraw and concentrate their forces in order to reduce their risks and make defence easier.  As a result, the invasion of German East Africa was postponed for some time."}

There were several attempts at extending the line beyond Fairford. The original scheme would have seen the line run from Cheltenham via Andoversford and the Coln Valley to Fairford and  where it would divide into two routes: an eastern branch to  and a southern line to join up with the Faringdon Railway. This was opposed by the Great Western Railway whose Cheltenham to Swindon line provided a shorter route to London and which was wary of proposals which might allow the London and North Western Railway to compete for its South Wales traffic. Agreement was reached with the Great Western for a modified route via  on the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway but the Great Western withdrew its support following objections from shareholders who felt that the scheme was a risky and unnecessary proposition. Although the East Gloucestershire Railway obtained Parliamentary approval for its initial proposal via Andoversford, it could not finance it and decided to concentrate on the section between Fairford and Witney. The next attempt was made in 1890 when the Great Western offered to purchase the East Gloucestershire and Witney Railways, leading the directors of the East Gloucestershire to enquire with the Witney directors as to whether they would support an approach to the Midland and South Western Junction Railway for an extension to Cirencester. The Witney directors declined as they had received a good offer from the Great Western for their shares. In 1895, the Midland Railway, London and North Western Railway and Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway proposed a trunk route to South Wales via Fairford and Oxford. This was defeated by the Great Western by buying off the support of the Manchester company through certain concessions. Another proposal came in 1899 when a group of local businessmen and landowners put forward a scheme under the Light Railways Act 1896 for a line parallel to the A40 road which was backed by the Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire County Councils but did not secure the support of the government and was abandoned in 1903. Finally, during the Second World War, thought was given to connecting the Fairford branch with the Highworth Branch Line using a  spur between Lechlade and Hannington. The upturn in fortunes meant that the proposal was not taken further.\n\nParagraph 2: His first return to the public was through a two-hour broadcast in 1963 for WBAI in New York, on which he played Alkan's works and discussed his life. The response to this program was overwhelming and brought a request from G. Schirmer to prepare an edition of Alkan's piano music. Encouraged by the reception, Lewenthal played a recital including Alkan's music in Town Hall, New York, in September 1964 - his first public appearance there in 12 years. This led to an RCA recording of Alkan's music which was met with critical raves, and then a three-concert Liszt Cycle in New York and London, among many other performances. Lewenthal came to be considered the leader of the \"Romantic Revival\", reintroducing solo and chamber works by many important but neglected 19th-century composers such as Moscheles, Goetz, Herz, Hummel, Henselt, Scharwenka, Rubinstein, Reubke, Field, Dussek and others, as well as reviving overlooked works by famous composers. He also took an active role in such events as the Romantic Festival at Butler University (Indianapolis) and Newport Music Festival. In 1971 he accepted an invitation to a well received tour of Southern Africa. Lewenthal taught at the Mannes College of Music and The Tanglewood Music Festival, and was a faculty member of the Manhattan School of Music for a number of years beginning in the mid-1970s. Among his doctoral students was Israeli pianist Astrith Baltsan.\n\nParagraph 3: Williams came into the Australian Open unseeded, because of her world no. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as \"out of shape\". Williams in her opening match faced 27th seed Mara Santangelo and lost only three games, with the help of ten aces. In her next match she faced qualifier Anne Kremer, which she had to break back when she was broken in the fifth game to push it to a tie-break. Kramer took four of the first five points, before Williams could win the last six to take the breaker. Williams then took the first four games of the second and eventually closed it out in the eight game. In the round of 32, Williams had 5th seed Nadia Petrova on the other side of the net. Petrova dominated the first set losing only a game and served for the match in the tenth game of the second. However, Williams broke back and won the next two games to take the second set when Petrova double faulted. Williams then took the deciding set with a single break lead, serving it out in the ninth game. This was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. In the fourth round, she faced 11th ranked Jelena Janković and cruised in straight sets with a drop of only five games. Williams fired eight aces to go with 31 winners and 28 errors. This is her first time since the 2005 Australian Open to get past the fourth round of a slam. In the last eight, she took on Shahar Pe'er. Pe'er broke in the first game and held the led through closing it out in the ninth game. Williams then took the last four games of the second set form the fifth game to take it to a decider. Williams broke in the fourth game, just for Pe'er to break back and get back on serve latter in the set. Pe'er then broke in the eleventh game and served for the match; Williams then broke back and won the next two games to go through. Williams had 49 unforced errors and only 30 winners. In the final 4, Williams faced 17-year-old Nicole Vaidišová. The first went to a tie-break in which Williams took the first four points then Vaidišová rallied to tie it at 5, Williams then took the next two points to take the set. Williams then broke Vaidišová twice and served for the match at the eight game, Vaidišová came back and broke and saved four match points on her own serve to hold. Williams then served it out in the tenth game. Tracy Austin in her tournament analysis stated that Williams had a great tournament but the ride was over and that Maria Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Serena thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation. In the first set, Williams took the first five games before Sharapova could get a game, Williams then held to close out the set. Williams then made four games in a row in the second before Sharapova could win a game, Williams served it out in the eight game and won the match. This is her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open. Williams finished with 28 winners and 11 unforced errors. Williams came the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded; and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased sister Yetunde Price.  Her performance in the final was described in the press as \"one of the best performances of her career\" and \"arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Balloons were by then in use for both meteorology and military observation. Balloons can only be used in light winds, while kites can only be used in stronger winds. The American Samuel Franklin Cody, working in England, realised that the two types of craft between them allowed operation over a wide range of weather conditions. He developed Hargrave's basic design, adding additional lifting surfaces to create powerful man-lifting systems using multiple kites on a single line. Cody made many demonstrations of his system and would later sell four of his \"war kite\" systems to the Royal Navy. His kites also found use in carrying meteorological instruments aloft and he was made a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society. In 1905, Sapper Moreton of the British Army's balloon section was lifted  by a kite at Aldershot under Cody's supervision. In 1906, Cody was appointed Chief Instructor in Kiting at the Army School of Ballooning in Aldershot. He soon also joined the newly established Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough and continued developing his war kites for the British Army. In his own time, he developed a manned \"glider-kite\" which was launched on a tether like a kite and then released to glide freely. In 1907, Cody next fitted an aircraft engine to a modified unmanned \"power-kite\", the precursor to his later aeroplanes, and flew it inside the Balloon Shed, along a wire suspended from poles, before the Prince and Princess of Wales. The British Army officially adopted his war kites for their Balloon Companies in 1908.\n\nParagraph 5: As soon as he enters the interior of the Spirit, however, he is attacked by two frightened Russians, who he is forced to kill. As he continues to explore, he encounters a multitude of panicking Russians, all of whom attack him. He also finds several horrifically mutilated bodies, including that of the Ravenswoods captain, Lt. Lansing. Hansen soon learns of a creature known as an \"exocel\", which was accidentally discovered by the crew of a Russian oil rig, the Star of Sakhalin, owned by Colonel Dmitriy Yusupov, a member of the Russian mafia, and staffed by Major Yuri Anischenko and his team of mercenaries. Yusupov came to realize the exocels were parasitic organisms, which used other living organisms as hosts, and as such, he brought Dr. Viktor Kamsky to the Sakhalin to begin experimenting with infecting various species with exocel serum. These experiments led to the discovery that exocels could re-animate recently deceased humans, and the creation of an antidote to counter infection. Hansen heads to the radio room to request help, but instead he is answered by Bennett, who tells him that Yusupov is on board and must be captured for questioning. Bennett tells Hansen that if he finds Yusupov, the CIA will get him off the ship.\n\nParagraph 6: A more modern form of the EPG, associated with both television and radio broadcasting, is the interactive [electronic] programming guide (IPG, though often referred to as EPG). An IPG allows television viewers and radio listeners to navigate scheduling information menus interactively, selecting and discovering programming by time, title, channel or genre using an input device such as a keypad, computer keyboard or television remote control. Its interactive menus are generated entirely within local receiving or display equipment using raw scheduling data sent by individual broadcast stations or centralized scheduling information providers. A typical IPG provides information covering a span of seven or 14 days.\n\nParagraph 7: Italian literary criticism has often looked at the decadent movement on a larger scale, proposing that its main features could be used to define a full historical period, running from the 1860s to the 1920s. For this reason, the term Decadentism, modelled on \"Romanticism\" or \"Expressionism\", became more substantial and widespread than elsewhere. However, most critics today prefer to distinguish between three periods. The first period is marked by the experience of Scapigliatura, a sort of proto-decadent movement. The Scapigliati (literally meaning \"unkempt\" or \"dishevelled\") were a group of writers and poets who shared a sentiment of intolerance for the suffocating intellectual atmosphere between the late Risorgimento (1860s) and the early years of unified Italy (1870s). They contributed to rejuvenate Italian culture through foreign influences and introduced decadent themes like illness and fascination with death. The novel Fosca (1869) by Igino Ugo Tarchetti tells of a love triangle involving a codependent man, a married woman and an ugly, sick and vampire-like figure, the femme fatale Fosca. In a similar way, Camillo Boito's Senso and his short stories venture into tales of sexual decadence and disturbing obsessions, such as incest and necrophilia. Other Scapigliati were the novelists Carlo Dossi and Giuseppe Rovani, the poet Emilio Praga, the poet and composer Arrigo Boito and the composer Franco Faccio. As for the visual arts, Medardo Rosso stands out as one of the most influential European sculptors of that time. Most of the Scapigliati died of illness, alcoholism or suicide. The second period of Italian Decadentism is dominated by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Antonio Fogazzaro and Giovanni Pascoli. D'Annunzio, who was in contact with many French intellectuals and had read the works of Nietzsche in the French translation, imported the concepts of Übermensch and will to power into Italy, although in his own particular version. The poet's aim had to be an extreme aestheticization of life, and life the ultimate work of art. Recurrent themes in his literary works include the supremacy of the individual, the cult of beauty, exaggerated sophistication, the glorification of machines, the fusion of man with nature, the exalted vitality coexisting with the triumph of death. His novel The Pleasure, published one year before The Picture of Dorian Gray, is considered one of the three genre-defining books of the Decadent movement, along with Wilde's novel and Huysmans's Against Nature. Less flashy and more isolated than D'Annunzio, and close to the French symbolists, Pascoli redefined poetry as a means of clairvoyance to regain the purity of things. Finally, the third period, which can be seen as a postlude to Decadentism, is marked by the voices of Italo Svevo, Luigi Pirandello and the Crepusculars. Svevo, with his novel Zeno's Conscience, took the idea of sickness to its logical conclusion, while Pirandello proceeded to the extreme disintegration of the self with works such as The Late Mattia Pascal, Six Characters in Search of an Author and One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand. On the other side, the Crepuscular poets (literally \"twilight poets\") turned Pascoli's innovations into a mood-conveying poetry, which describes the melancholy of everyday life in shady and monotonous interiors of provincial towns. These atmospheres were explored by the painters Mario Sironi, Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi. Guido Gozzano was the most brilliant and ironic of the Crepusculars, but we can also remember Sergio Corazzini, Marino Moretti and Aldo Palazzeschi.\n\nParagraph 8: On Wednesday, November 14, Darrell Cain gave his testimony in his own defense. Cain claimed that he and Arnold found the Rodriguez brothers in their bed, and that they looked sweaty. Arnold told Cain that the brothers were the ones he saw running from the gas station. Cain and Arnold put the boys in handcuffs behind their backs and took them to a parking lot behind the burglarized gas station. Cain recalled that he and Arnold met officers Foster and McKee and that Arnold claimed there may have been a third burglar. According to Cain, when Arnold asked Santos if the boys had another brother, Santos affirmed that they did but that he did not know where his other brother was. Cain told Arnold that he would \"make him [Santos] tell the truth\", and took his pistol between his legs, emptied it, and visually checked that there were no bullets in the gun before closing the gun's chamber. Cain then pointed the gun at Santos and pulled the trigger, making a clicking sound. He warned Santos to tell the truth, and that there was a bullet in the gun. The second time Cain pulled the trigger, a shot fired, killing Santos. Cain described how he grabbed the bullets from his lap, jumped from the car, and put the bullets back into the gun while he was out of the vehicle. Cain said he was in shock and hysterical, and that he cried over what had happened. Mulder cross-examined Cain and asked if it was within normal police procedure to interrogate a young boy using a gun. Cain responded that it was not. Mulder asked Cain what made him set himself up as a judge of truth, and Cain responded that he did not know. Mulder had Cain reenact the incident in front of the jury. In response to Cain's previous claims that he had pressed his gun's ejector rod to empty it of bullets, Mulder demonstrated that the bullets would fall out of the gun if it were merely tilted. Mulder loaded and unloaded the gun by turning the cylinder upside down several times. Mulder questioned Cain about his claim that he reloaded the pistol, stating that Foster claimed he did not see Cain reload his gun outside of the car. Cain responded that he did indeed reload his gun, but that in the confusion nobody saw him. Mulder asked Cain what Santos' last words were, and Cain responded that they were \"I am telling the truth.\"\n\nParagraph 9: For 1973, The Surtees team updated the TS14 into the TS14A and the driver line up was former motorcycle champion, Englishman Mike Hailwood and Brazilian José Carlos Pace. The first race of 1973 was the 1973 Argentine Grand Prix and both drivers retired on the same lap, Hailwood with suspension failure and Pace with a broken halfshaft. At Brazil the Englishman retired with a broken gearbox and the Brazilian at his home track retired with suspension failure. At the South African Grand Prix, both drivers retired with accidents, Pace had a flat tyre and Hailwood crashed with Clay Regazzoni's BRM. Regazzoni's car burst into flames with the unconscious Swiss driver at the wheel. Hailwood dived into the flames, undid Regazzoni's belts and managed to drag him clear. Hailwood was later awarded the George Medal for his bravery. Regazzoni was rushed to hospital but he had only minor burns. Both drivers retired at Spain, the Englishman with an oil leak and the Brazilian with a broken halfshaft. The Belgian Grand Prix saw Pace finish eighth and Hailwood retire with an accident. At Monaco, the Englishman finished eighth and the Brazilian retired with a broken halfshaft. The Swedish Grand Prix saw Hailwood retire with a tyre problem and Pace finished 10th, At France, the Englishman retired with an oil Leak and the Brazilian finished 13th. The British Grand Prix saw Jochen Mass join Pace and Hailwood for a one off drive but all were eliminated in a first lap crash with Jody Scheckter (McLaren), Jean-Pierre Beltoise (BRM), Andrea de Adamich (Brabham), Roger Williamson (March) and the Shadow cars of George Follmer (Works Shadow), Jackie Oliver (Works Shadow) and Graham Hill (privateer Shadow) all involved. Hill was the only one able to drive away from the scene. At Holland, the Englishman retired with an electrical problem and the Brazilian finished seventh. The German Grand Prix saw Mass rejoin the team for a one off drive alongside Pace and Hailwood and all three drivers finished, Pace fourth, Mass seventh and Hailwood 14th. At Austria, the Englishman finished tenth and the Brazilian third. The Italian Grand Prix saw Hailwood seventh and Pace retired with a tyre problem. At Canada, the Englishman finished ninth and the Brazilian retired with wheel problems. The United States Grand Prix saw Mass rejoin the team for a one off drive alongside Pace and Hailwood and all three drivers retired, Pace and Hailwood had suspension failure and Mass with engine failure.\n\nParagraph 10:  Kolkata Urban Agglomeration includes :  Kolkata district: Kolkata (M Corp.), Nadia district: Kalyani (M), Gayespur (M), North 24 Parganas district: Raigachhi (CT), Barasat (M), Madhyamgram (M), Kanchrapara (M),  Nanna (OG), Chakla (OG), Srotribati (OG), Jetia (CT), Halisahar (M), Balibhara (CT), Naihati (M), Noapara (P) (CT), Babanpur (CT), Teghari (CT), Bhatpara (M), Panpur (OG), Kaugachhi (CT), Garshyamnagar (CT), Garulia (M), Ichhapur Defence Estate (CT), North Barrackpur (M), Barrackpur Cantonment (CB), Barrackpur (M), Jafarpur (CT), Ruiya (CT), Titagarh (M), Khardaha (M), Bandipur (CT), Panihati (M), Muragachha (CT), New Barrackpur (M), Chandpur (CT), Talbandha (CT), Patulia (CT), Kamarhati (M), Baranagar (M), South Dum Dum (M), North Dum Dum (M), Dum Dum (M), Rajarhat-Gopalpur (M) [now merged with Bidhannagar (M Corp.)], Bidhannagar (M Corp.), Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (Salt Lake Sector V) (M), West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corp (New Town) (M),  Hooghly district: Dankuni (M Corp) Bansberia (M), Hugli-Chinsurah (M), Bara Khejuria (OG), Shankhanagar (CT),  Amodghata (CT),  Chak Banshberia (CT), Naldanga (CT), Kodalia (CT), Kulihanda (CT), Simla (CT), Dharmapur (CT), Bhadreswar (M), Champdani (M), Chandannagar (M Corp.), Baidyabati (M), Serampore (M), Rishra (M), Rishra (CT), Bamunari (CT), Dakshin Rajyadharpur (CT), Nabagram Colony (CT), Konnagar (M), Uttarpara Kotrung (M), Raghunathpur (PS-Dankuni) (CT), Kanaipur (CT), Keota (CT), Howrah district: Bally (M) [Now merged with Howrah (M Corp.)], Howrah (M Corp.), Bally (CT), Jagadishpur (CT), Chamrail (CT), Eksara (CT), Chakapara (CT), Khalia (CT), Bankra (CT), Nibra (CT), Mahiari (CT), Bipra Noapara (CT), Ankurhati (CT), Kantlia (CT), Salap (CT), Tentulkuli (CT), 83 Argari (CT), Andul (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Jhorhat (CT), Hatgachha (CT), Dhuilya (CT), Panchpara (CT), Podara (CT), Banupur (CT), Sankrail (CT), Manikpur (CT), Sarenga (CT), Raghudebbati (CT), Nalpur (CT), Uluberia (M), Chak Srikrishna (OG), Khalisani (CT), Uttar Pirpur (CT), Balarampota (CT), Santoshpur (CT), Domjur (CT), Dakshin Jhapardaha (CT), Makardaha (CT), Khantora (CT), Bhandardaha (CT), Kamranga (CT), Jaypur Bil (CT), South 24 Parganas district: Joka (CT), Chata Kalikapur (CT), Ganye Gangadharpur (CT), Rameswarpur (CT), Asuti (CT), Hanspukuria (CT), Kalua (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Samali (CT), Maheshtala (M), Uttar Raypur (CT), Balarampur (CT), Buita (CT), Benjanhari Acharial (CT), Abhirampur (CT), Nischintapur (CT), Birlapur (CT), Chak Kashipur (CT), Chak Alampur (CT), Bowali (CT), Dakshin Raypur (CT), Poali (CT), Pujali (M), Budge Budge (M), Daulatpur (CT), Bhasa (CT), Bishnupur (CT), Kanyanagar (CT), Nahazari (CT), Nadabhanga (CT), Kanganbaria (CT), Bora Gagangohalia (CT), Chanddandaha (CT), Barkalikapur (CT), Patharberia (CT), Ramkrishnapur (CT), Amtala (CT), Kriparampur (CT), Chak Enayetnagar (CT), Maricha (CT), Bhangar Raghunathpur (CT), Gobindapur (CT), Radhanagar (CT), Danga (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Bidyadharpur (CT), Kalikapur (CT), Chak Baria (CT), Sahebpur (CT), Rajpur Sonarpur (M), Petua (CT), Garia (CT), Panchghara (CT), Mallikpur (CT), Hariharpur (CT), Champahati (CT), Solgohalia (CT), Naridana (CT), Salipur (CT), Khodar Bazar (CT), Komarhat (CT), Baruipur (M), Raynagar (CT), Kalikapur Barasat (CT), Baharu (CT), Uttarparanij (CT), Alipur (CT), Uttar Durgapur (CT), Jaynagar Majilpur (M)."}
{"queries": ["The text explains that cyclopropanones, which are three-membered ring ketones, undergo hydration to a significant extent. This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals.", "The text is about a woman named Güzin who receives a letter from her husband, Azmi, after not hearing from him for ten days. Güzin spends time with her friend Sadan, who recently got engaged to Turan. Sadan's health begins to deteriorate, and she starts sleepwalking. One night, Güzin follows Sadan and witnesses her being attacked by Dracula near the seashore. Sadan falls ill, and doctors try to figure out her mysterious illness. Güzin learns that Azmi is in the hospital, so she goes to bring him home. Dr. Nuri suggests blood transfusions and putting garlic in Sadan's room to protect her. However, Sadan's mother removes the garlic necklace, and Dracula attacks Sadan, causing her mother to die of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return too late, and Sadan dies, only to rise as a vampire. The group joins forces to fight against Dracula, and Dr. Nuri reveals his suspicions about the vampire. They go to the graveyard and find that Sadan's coffin is empty.", "Liane Brauch Russel, born in 1923 in Vienna, Austria, was forced to flee her home due to the Nazi regime and her Jewish heritage. She moved to London and eventually to the United States, where she pursued a college education in chemistry and biology.

Soviet troops attempted to cross from the Pest riverside by boats in January 1945, but the defending Hungarian and German units thwarted their attempt and sunk the rubber dinghies. On the night of January 19 the ice on the river was thick enough for a few Soviet patrols to cross on foot, and as the sentries in the boat houses overlooking the river fell asleep, they managed to infiltrate and established a bridgehead. The attack soon stalled as the defenders, now trapped in the northern end of the island, managed to stop their advance. Additionally a Soviet marine platoon was also trapped in the northernmost tip of the island, among the half-finished pillars of Árpád Bridge. Several days of close quarters battle followed for the buildings of the island, particularly in the bath houses where the opposing units spent days in their close vicinity. During this time both sides pounded the island with artillery, the Soviets from the Pest side, the Hungarians from the Castle of Buda. Ultimately on January 28 the defenders managed to sneak out under the darkness of the night on rowboats and through the still standing western span of Margaret Bridge to Buda, which was later blown up by Ukrainian SS troops.\n\nParagraph 2: M. Govindan was born on September 18, 1919 at Kuradadesham, in Thrikkanapuram, Ponnani, Malappuram district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Kothayath Manakkal Chithran Nampoothiri and Mancherath Thazhathethil Devaki Amma. His schooling was at Higher Elementary School, Kuttippuram, and A.V. High School, Ponnani but had formal education only up to 9th standard. He became a socialist, reading Why Socialism by Jayaprakash Narayan, given to him by the poet Idassery Govindan Nair, but never a Marxist. When his mother remarried Karunakaran Nair, a police official based in Chennai and moved there, Govindan also settled in that city. According to the biography of Govindan, written by his close associate M K Sanoo, Govindan never took part in freedom movement and shifted to Madras only because his mother got married again. In 1944 he joined Madras Information service, shifted to Kerala Information Department along with his friend A N Nambiar, after states re organization;  worked in the information service for 14 years. It was the British rule that recruited him, and the information service was propagating British views on Second World War. He was given a job at the recommendation of P Balasubramanya Mudaliar, Editor of Sunday Observer, mouth piece of the Justice Party. Govindan had  embraced the Radical Humanism of erstwhile Marxist M N Roy in 1939; both were against Gandhi and the Quit India movement. His friendship with Roy began when Roy, as Editor of Independent India, published Govindan's article, Caste and Class in South India. Subsequent exchange of letters made Govindan, a disciple of Roy. He had been in active politics prior to that and according to Sanoo, had written a couple of articles in leftist magazines such as Thozhilali and Rajyabhamani. C J Thomas met him in 1949, when he went to Madras and made an unsuccessful attempt to study MLitt, and joined the USIS. Their friendship ultimately bloomed in their joint effort against the first elected Communist Government in India, in the infamous liberation struggle, funded by the CIA. Govindan worked against the first Communist government of Kerala during 1957–1959, and exposed the Andhra rice scandal of that government, which was toppled by the CIA, according to the book, A Dangerous Place by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Govindan organized several pamphlets against the government, one of which was written by Sanoo.In 1959, he resigned from service and concentrated on his intellectual career. He edited three magazines Navasahiti, Gopuram and Sameeksha and organised many academic forums for cultural debate. He spotted and groomed many young writers and artists through his magazines. He also wrote profusely both in Malayalam and English,  but his creative works were largely in Malayalam.\n\nParagraph 3: David was the son of baronet John Hans Makeléer (1604-1666).

David Makeléer had the following siblings: Carl Leonard Makeléer (1633-1663); Catharina Makeléer (1637-1709); Anna Makeléer (1638-1646); Lunetta Makeléer (1639-1693) who married Joakim Cronman (c1630-1703), a soldier who died at Neumünde; Gustaf Adolf Makeléer (1641-1706) who was a Captain in the Swedish Army who married Sara Carlberg (1647-1701); and Elsa Beata Makeléer (1643-1730). He married Eleonora Elisabet von Ascheberg (1663-1737) in 1679, she was the daughter of Field Marshal Rutger von Ascheberg, Count of Söfdeborg. David then served as the first governor of Älvsborg County, Sweden from 1693 to 1708.\n\nParagraph 4: Tobias S.

He currently lives in Bluffton, Ohio, where he works as an instructor at the Stonecoast MFA in the Creative Writing program.\n\nParagraph 5: Liane Brauch Russel was born in 1923 to a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria. Her father was a chemical engineer while her mother taught singing, and she was the oldest out of her two other siblings. As a child, her parents were very encouraging of Liane's inquiring mind and constantly reminded her that girls could do anything boys could do. However, despite her parents' evident kind-heartedness, the world was at a loss for morality during the later years of Liane's childhood. In 1938, Austria was annexed by the Nazis, and due to Liane's Jewish heritage, she and her family were forced to flee Austria to London. Liane and her family lost their house and possessions, and her father even lost his entire business to the Nazi regime. After several years in England, Liane moved to the United States, where she decided to further her education at Hunter College in New York City. She studied chemistry and biology and completed a summer research assistantship at Jackson Laboratory, a biomedical research institution that focuses on studying human biology and genomics. Interestingly enough, through the assistantship, her supervisor, William Russel, a leading geneticist at the time, would later become both Liane's husband and research partner. Upon graduation from Hunter College in 1945, Liane went back to Jackson Laboratory before moving to the University of Chicago to pursue her Ph.D. in Zoology. After initiating her Ph.D., Liane went to work at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which played a vital role in the development of nuclear weapons through the Manhattan Project in WWII. Liane was fortunate enough to work alongside her husband, William Russell, as they both had a mission to study the effects of radiation exposure on mice. Mice share various genetic qualities with humans and thus were the perfect test subjects for Liane's radiation experiments. The essential pain point Liane was looking to solve was that the current information surrounding the effects of radiation on congenital disabilities was insufficient and inconclusive. Essentially, Liane was looking to innovate on recent research and prove the harmful effects that radiation can have on humans. Thus, she began researching how radiation affects mice embryos at certain stages in their development. Through this research, Liane discovered a variety of different deformities that would arise within the embryos at different stages of growth. Through Liane's findings, she determined that the most critical time of human gestation is within the first two to six weeks, during which most women do not even know they are pregnant. Both Liane and her husband published a paper describing their findings. The report recommended that women who may be pregnant only receive specific radiological procedures during the two weeks after their last menstrual cycle when they are most likely not pregnant. The paper was published in 1952 and received heavy criticism and controversy from radiologists. However, despite heavy criticism, the innovative research that both Liane and her husband performed became known as the 14-day rule and became a radiological practice accepted in almost every country. And to this day, this innovative rule is still a prominent rule among radiologists internationally. These findings have protected millions of pregnant women from premature radiation procedures that would've had detrimental effects on their pregnancies and children in the 1950s and the present day. Furthermore, Liane has received a variety of awards for her research. She was awarded the Roentgen Medal in 1973, became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1986, and received the Enrico Fermi Award from the Department of Energy in 1994. Likewise, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory created the Liane B. Russell Distinguished Early Career Fellowship, a program primarily for minority and female scientists who help them get early exposure to various scientific fields. Inevitably, Liane Russell played a pivotal role in the radiation field and discovered its harmful effects on developing embryos. And her innovative research has been able to save lives and improve the overarching areas of science and medicine both during her life and after.\n\nParagraph 6: Back in Turkey, Azmi's wife Güzin receives one of his letters. She frets because it is the first she has heard from him in ten days. Güzin spends her time with her best friend, Sadan. Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately, though Sadan seems happy as she recently became engaged to Turan. Güzin and Sadan go to the seashore, and while taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disappeared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. Güzin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. Güzin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif, and Dr. Nuri is called to examine Sadan, noticing that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. Güzin meanwhile learns that Azmi is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr. Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan, and also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan's mother removes the necklace, and The Count breaks the window to Sadan's room and attacks her. Sadan's mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, the marks from her neck have vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as a vampire, who preys on children. Dr. Nuri, Azmi, Güzin, Dr. Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr. Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children's throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan's wounds, but were made by Sadan herself. Dr. Nuri leads Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, Sadan's coffin is empty.\n\nParagraph 7: Congress expanded the Corps of Cadets to 2,496 in 1942, and the academy reverted to a three-year course of study. The Class of 1943 was redesignated the Class of January 1943 and graduated six months early. Subsequent classes, from June 1943 through 1947, graduated in three years. The war years brought a greater emphasis on military training. In 1943, summer training was formally moved from the Plain to the new area recently acquired southwest of main post, which would later become Camp Buckner. Flight training was conducted at Stewart Field in Newburgh, and the academy graduated more than 1,000 commissioned pilots between 1943 and 1946. Nearly 500 graduates gave their lives in World War II.  In 1945, Maxwell Taylor (class of 1922) became superintendent, ushering in the beginnings of the modern Military Academy.  Taylor expanded the size of departments, added several new professors, abolished antiquated courses in fencing and horsemanship, inserted the study of amphibious operations into the military curriculum, and added courses in nuclear physics, electronics and communications. In response to Eisenhower's belief that American leaders needed to understand the psychology of the citizen soldier, courses were added in leadership and applied psychology. These changes provided graduates with a better understanding of how to motivate and lead the soldiers of a free society. Coursework in the humanities and social sciences increased to 40 percent of a cadet's total workload.  When the Korean War began, the academy continued on a steady course and did not face major disruption from the conflict.  The Korean War and an honor scandal in 1951 led to a decline in admissions, so that by 1954, only 67% of the academy's authorized strength was filled. The academy responded with its first modern advertising campaign.\" In 1955, the Hollywood motion picture The Long Gray Line, based upon another book by Colonel Reeder and his sister, was completed, and the CBS dramatic series The West Point Story aired on television. Colonel Russell \"Red\" Reeder, Class of 1926, wrote several popular novels about fictional West Point cadets which first appeared in 1955. A massive review of the curriculum led to the introduction of electives, growing from zero electives that a cadet could have in his career in the late 1950s, to a maximum of eight by 1972. The increasing sophistication of the curriculum also affected the organization of the academic departments with, for example, the creation of two new departments in 1969 -the Department of History and the Department of Engineering. In the 1960s, the size of the Corps expanded from 2,200 to 4,400. Following the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947 and until the graduation of the first United States Air Force Academy class in 1959, West Point cadets who met the eligibility standards could apply to be commissioned as Air Force officers.\n\nParagraph 8: Since the beginning of his rule, Progoni sought out to create friendly networks in foreign policy in order to preserve the sovereignty of Arbanon against external threats, the most important of whom were for much of his reign the Republic of Venice and later the Despotate of Epiros. In 1208-09, he considered conversion to Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy for the first time in order to obtain support against his Venetian rivals. As Venice had been given the nominal rights to control Albania, conversion to Catholicism would nullify Venetian claims over territory controlled by another Catholic state, the Principality of Arbanon. It would also protect him from expansion by post-Byzantine successor states like the Despotate of Epiros. In his preserved correspondence with Pope Innocent III, Progoni as leader of the iudices of Arbanon, who signed as his followers, asked the Pope to send missionaries to spread Catholicism in his land. The Pope responded that Nicolaus, the Catholic archdeacon of Durrës had been instructed to make preparations for the mission. Shortly after, however, Demetrio stopped the process because he didn't consider it important any longer. He had defeated  Đorđe Nemanjić, a Venetian vassal whom he bordered to the north and thus felt less threatened by Venice. Nemanjić had previously promised military support to Venice if Progoni attacked Venetian territory, in a treaty signed on 3 July 1208. He also had secured a marriage with Komnena Nemanjić, who was both the daughter of Stefan Nemanjić, rival of Đorđe Nemanjić and grand-daughter of the last Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos. In this context, because of the relation of his consort to the Byzantine imperial family, he was recognized by the title of panhypersevastos. After the death of the Catholic archbishop of Durrës, the Venetians and Progoni - each in their respective territories - seized church property. For his actions against church property, he was excommunicated. He used the title princeps Arbanorum (\"prince of the Albanians\") to refer to himself and was recognized as such by foreign dignitaries. In the correspondence with Innocent III, the territory he claimed as princeps Arbanorum was the area between Shkodra, Prizren, Ohrid and Durrës (regionis montosae inter Scodram, Dyrrachium, Achridam et Prizrenam sitae). In general, Progoni brought the principality to its climax. The area the principality controlled, ranged from the Shkumbin river valley to the Drin river valley in the north and from the Adriatic sea to the Black Drin in the east.  In Latin documents, he was is also referred to as iudex. In Byzantine records, he is titled as megas archon and after the consolidation of his rule as panhypersebastos.\n\nParagraph 9: On 14 June 1968 Knox-Johnston left Falmouth in his 32-foot (9.8-metre) boat Suhaili, one of the smallest boats to enter the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Despite losing his self-steering gear off Australia, he rounded Cape Horn on 17 January 1969, 20 days before his closest competitor Bernard Moitessier. Moitessier had sailed from Plymouth more than two months after Knox-Johnston, but he subsequently abandoned the race and instead sailed on to Tahiti. The other seven competitors dropped out at various stages, leaving Knox-Johnston to win the race and become officially the first person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed on 22 April 1969, the day he returned to Falmouth. Knox-Johnston donated his prize money for fastest competitor, a sum of £5,000, to the family of Donald Crowhurst, another competitor in the race who had committed suicide after attempting to fake his round the world voyage.\n\nParagraph 10: Cyclopropanones- three-membered ring ketones- are also hydrated to a significant extent. Since three-membered rings are very strained (bond angles forced to be 60˚), sp3 hybridization is more favorable than sp2 hybridization. For the sp3 hybridized hydrate the bonds have to be distorted by about 49˚, while for the sp2 hybridized ketone the bond angle distortion is about 60˚. So the addition to the carbonyl group allows some of the strain inherent in the small ring to be released, which is why cyclopropanone and cyclobutanone are very reactive electrophiles. For larger rings, where the bond angles are not as distorted, the stability of the hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. Formation of an acyclic acetal involves a decrease in entropy because two molecules are consumed for every one produced. In contrast, the formation of cyclic hemiacetals involves a single molecule reacting with itself, making the reaction more favorable. Another way to understand the stability of cyclic hemiacetals is to look at the equilibrium constant as the ratio of the forward and backward reaction rate. For a cyclic hemiacetal the reaction is intramolecular so the nucleophile is always held close to the carbonyl group ready to attack, so the forward rate of reaction is much higher than the backward rate. Many biologically relevant sugars, such as glucose, are cyclic hemiacetals.       "}
{"queries": ["In the spring of 1882, Na-tio-tisha, a warrior from the White Mountain Apache tribe, led a group of approximately 60 Apache warriors. They ambushed and killed four San Carlos policemen in early July, causing alarm among local Arizona settlers who demanded protection from the U.S. Army. As a result, fourteen companies of U.S. Cavalry were sent from forts across the region. Na-tio-tisha and his party traveled northwest through the Tonto Basin, with the intention of reaching General Springs on the Crook Trail. They were followed by a single troop of cavalry led by Captain Adna Chaffee. Realizing they were being trailed, the Apaches set up an ambush seven miles north of General Springs, hiding on the far side of a gorge.

However, starting in 1989, the team faced a streak of 11 consecutive losing seasons. In 1990, pitcher Charles Thompson even set a South Atlantic League record of 17 losses. The team rebranded as the Charleston RiverDogs in 1994 but did not manage to turn their luck around. However, in 1997, they moved to a new stadium called Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park, which helped increase their total attendance by over 100,000 fans. In the same year, the RiverDogs also began an eight-year affiliation with the Tampa Bay Rays.

Powers participated, with his squadron, in 5 engagements with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea area and adjacent waters during the period 4 to 8 May 1942. Three attacks were made on enemy objectives at or near Tulagi on 4 May. In these attacks he scored a direct hit which instantly demolished a large enemy gunboat or destroyer and is credited with 2 close misses, 1 of which severely damaged a large aircraft tender, the other damaging a 20,000-ton transport. He fearlessly strafed a gunboat, firing all his ammunition into it amid intense antiaircraft fire. This gunboat was then observed to be leaving a heavy oil slick in its wake and later was seen beached on a nearby island. On 7 May, an attack was launched against an enemy airplane carrier and other units of the enemy's invasion force. He fearlessly led his attack section of 3 Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, to attack the carrier. On this occasion he dived in the face of heavy antiaircraft fire, to an altitude well below the safety altitude, at the risk of his life and almost certain damage to his own plane, in order that he might positively obtain a hit in a vital part of the ship, which would insure her complete destruction. This bomb hit was noted by many pilots and observers to cause a tremendous explosion engulfing the ship in a mass of flame, smoke, and debris. The ship sank soon after. That evening, in his capacity as Squadron Gunnery Officer, Lt. Powers gave a lecture to the squadron on point-of-aim and diving technique. During this discourse he advocated low release point in order to insure greater accuracy; yet he stressed the danger not only from enemy fire and the resultant low pull-out, but from own bomb blast and bomb fragments. Thus his low-dive bombing attacks were deliberate and premeditated, since he well knew and realized the dangers of such tactics, but went far beyond the call of duty in order to further the cause which he knew to be right. The next morning, 8 May, as the pilots of the attack group left the ready room to man planes, his indomitable spirit and leadership were well expressed in his own words, \"Remember the folks back home are counting on us. I am going to get a hit if I have to lay it on their flight deck.\" He led his section of dive bombers down to the target from an altitude of 18,000 feet, through a wall of bursting antiaircraft shells and into the face of enemy fighter planes. Again, completely disregarding the safety altitude and without fear or concern for his safety, Lt. Powers courageously pressed home his attack, almost to the very deck of an enemy carrier and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct hit. He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of 200 feet, and amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments, smoke, flame and debris from the stricken vessel.\n\nParagraph 2: The village of Koningsbosch has a thriving association culture. In 1992 the local shooting club (Schutterij St. Joseph) won the OLS.

Local Arizona settlers were greatly alarmed and demanded protection from the U.S. Army. It sent out fourteen companies of U.S. Cavalry from forts across the region. In the middle of July, Na-tio-tisha led his war-party up Cherry Creek to the Mogollon Rim, intending to reach General Springs, a well-known water hole on the Crook Trail. Noticing they were being trailed by a single troop of cavalry, the Apache lay an ambush seven miles north of General Springs, where a fork of East Clear Creek cuts a gorge into the Mogollon Rim. The Apaches hid on the far side and waited. The cavalry company was led by Captain Adna Chaffee. The chief scout, Al Sieber, discovered the Apache trap and warned the troops. During the night, Chaffee's lone company was reinforced by four more from Fort Apache under the command of Major A.W. Evans. Then they were ready to begin the Battle of Big Dry Wash.\n\nParagraph 4: SR 37 begins at the Alabama state line on the western edge of Fort Gaines, in Clay County, where the roadway continues to the west as Alabama State Route 10 (SR 10; Hartford Road) over the Chattahoochee River on the Henry G McKemie Memorial Bridge. In Fort Gaines is a very brief concurrency with SR 39. It continues to the east, to an intersection with US 27/SR 1 in Suttons Corner. Then, it cuts across a corner of Calhoun County and re-enters Clay County. At the unincorporated community of Jeff, the highway re-enters Calhoun County. Southwest of there, in Edison, is a brief concurrency with SR 216. It heads east and curves to the southeast to enter Morgan, where it has a short concurrency with SR 45. Continuing to the southeast, it crosses over Ichawaynochaway Creek, then passes McClendon Lake and enters Leary. In the city is an intersection with SR 55 and SR 62 (Mercer Avenue). At this intersection, SR 62 travels concurrent with SR 37 until it splits off onto Albany Highway. The highway heads east-southeast, curves to the south-southeast, and travels in a nearly-due south direction, before entering Baker County. SR 37 gradually curves to the south and bends to the south-southwest and meets the southern terminus of SR 216 (Blakely Highway). Then, it curves to the east-southeast, crosses over Chickasawhatchee Creek, and travels through Elmodel. Farther to the southeast, it intersects SR 200, just before entering Newton. In the city, it intersects SR 91. On the southeastern edge of the city, it crosses over the Flint River and enters Mitchell County. The highway travels through rural areas of the county and enters Camilla. There, it begins to curve to the east and meets the western terminus of SR 37 Conn. (West Oakland Avenue). A few blocks to the east is an intersection with SR 112 (Scott Street). Just over  later is US 19/SR 3/SR 300 (Georgia–Florida Parkway). A little farther to the east, SR 37 leaves town and runs through rural areas of the county to an intersection with SR 93. Just south of Mims Millpond, it enters Colquitt County. The highway travels through Hartsfield and Funston, until it enters Moultrie. There, it begins a concurrency with SR 111. Just over  later, they cross over the Ochlockonee River and travel along the Riverside–Moultrie city line. A short distance later, also on the city line, is the end of the concurrency, with SR 111 departing on West Bypass NW. SR 37 continues to travel along the city line until the intersection with 11th Street SW/Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive NW, where it re-enters Moultrie proper. In downtown Moultrie is an intersection with US 319 Bus./SR 33. Farther to the east, it crosses over Okapilco Creek and intersects US 319/SR 35/SR 133. The four highways travel concurrently to the north for about . There, SR 37 splits off to the northeast onto 4th Street NE.\n\nParagraph 5: John George Wood was born in London, son of the surgeon John Freeman Wood and his German-born wife Juliana Lisetta Arntz. His parents moved with him to Oxford the following year, and he was educated at home, at Ashbourne Grammar School and Merton College, Oxford (B.A., 1848, M.A., 1851), and then at Christ Church, where he worked for some time in the anatomical museum under Sir Henry Acland. In 1852 he became curate of the parish of St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford, and in 1854 was ordained priest; he also took up the post of chaplain to the Boatmen's Floating Chapel at Oxford. Among other benefices which he held, he was for a time chaplain to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1878 Wood settled in Upper Norwood, where he lived until his death.\n\nParagraph 6: The Emperor wore a golden robe, purple trousers and wore his hair in a bun fastened with a golden brooch. The court officials and aristocrats wore a dark tunic having four flaps, closely buttoned collar, dark trousers, and wore a bun with an iron brooch. On their heads they wore a black gauze chuddar and peaked cap. They also wore leather sandals and carried fans of stork feathers. The military uniforms were “dau mau” cap covering the ears, knee-length tunic, neatly sewn sleeves tightly fitted around the wrist. The whole of the frock was covered with small pieces of armor plate full of spiral designs, or patterns of multiple large petalled flowers at the chest. In addition, there were patterns of parallel curved brims or spiral designs below which hung small bells, drooping fringes, and finally a line of bells. For some other kinds of frocks, the shoulder straps were adorned with bells, and the two shoulder bands and waistband decorated with tiger-face designs. The surface of the frock was decorated with prominent small multi-petalled flowers. The fabric had a tiled or scaled pattern, which might have been embroidered or woven into the fabric. A waistband made of cloth was tied with the ends dropping to the front. If a leather waistband was worn, it would be tightly fastened around the belly to reveal the body muscles. The boots reached up to the knee and were simply decorated. Female dancers had a “skyward” bun, a decorative fringe of hair on the forehead, with flowers adorning the hair. They wore bracelets, strings of beads, as well as multi-pleated short skirts. The musician's costumes were quite original. A cap fully covered the hair, with a high and zigzag-fringed top. The inner shirt was with long sleeves, tight at the wrist. Added to that, there was a short-sleeved shirt, with vân kiên shards. They wore wide embroidered and fringed strips of cloth around the waist. On their calves were leggings, and covering the feet were pointed-toe canvas shoes.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1985, the team was renamed the Charleston Rainbows and became affiliated with the San Diego Padres. From 1985 to 1987 were the building years as the Rainbows improved each season under a great pitching staff until 1988 when they won the Southern Division title but were bounced in the first round of the playoffs. The 1988 season was powered by a pitching staff whose combined ERA equaled 2.07. 1988 was the last of the \"good ol' days\", because starting in 1989 the team suffered 11 consecutive losing seasons. Poor play on the field translated into a South Atlantic League record, when in 1990 pitcher Charles Thompson registered 17 losses. In 1994 the team was renamed Charleston RiverDogs. Despite the name change, the losing continued. In 1997 saw the RiverDogs leave the 84-year-old College Park and move into the brand-new 5,500-seat Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park. The team also began its eight-year affiliation with the Tampa Bay Rays in 1997. The move to the \"Joe\" helped to spur a rise in total attendance, as the team set a record with an increase in over 100,000 fans. In 1998, the RiverDogs were the first professional baseball team to broadcast live video on the internet, and the first team to broadcast video of their entire home season.\n\nParagraph 8: The caliphate armed forces had attacked the island of Crete from the 7th century AD onwards, as the ‘Abbasid navy during the rule of Caliph Harun al-Rashid had sent Humayd ibn Ma’yuf al-Hamdani for this purpose. During the reign of Caliph al-Ma’mun, he sent Abu Hafs ‘Umar ibn ‘Isa al-Andalusi, more famously known as al-Ikritish.  Later, Crete once again by the Muslim force from Spain during the reign of al-Ma’mun. In the year 226 AH/841 AD, a peace treaty was ratified by Theophilus and Caliph al-Mu‘tasim that was in force, until the Caliph ordered a naval expedition to attack Constantinople, while later in the year 227 AH/842 AD, the naval enterprise that was led Abu Dinar with 400 men to sail from the port of Levant. The Caliph died in the same year as Theophilus and did not live to witness the destruction of his navy as the naval forces of the caliphate were hit by a sea storm at Chelidonian along the coast of Lycian. Seven Abbasid battleships later made a decision to return to the Levant. At the end of the 3rd AH/early 10th AD, the Abbasid navy was already considered as formidable power in the Aegean Sea. At this time, there was a plot within the Byzantine nobility to depose Emperor Leo VI, known as Leo VI the Wise by General Andronicus, who was supported by his son, Constantine and an aristocrat named Eustace. This combination of three prominent rebels joining forces strength from the aspect of feudal land and naval commander descent. From the year 894 AD., Eustace was the Byzantine chief admiral.  In the year 289 AH/August 902 AD, Eustace engaged in conflict with the Muslim army and during the winter had met up with Nicholas Mysticus to come to an understanding for the common interest of all and the church. Samonas, an Arabic eunuch, had entered into the Emperor's service and helped Emperor Leo VI to abort a plan by the relatives of Augusta Zoe who wished to overthrow the Emperor. Samonas was then placed in personal service to the Emperor. However, Samonas attempted to flee to Levant in March 904 AD after betraying the Emperor, but was caught and brought back by the Byzantines. On Leo VI's order, Samonas was executed. In the middle of Sha‘ban 291 AH/early July 904 AD, the naval army had 54 galleys which each of them carrying about 200 fighters as well as officers and was led by the Rashid al-Wardani or Ghulam Zurafa.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1945 the National Mapping Council (NMC) of Australia, comprising Commonwealth and State authorities, was formed to coordinate survey and mapping activities after the Second World War. Despite the huge wartime mapping achievements of producing 224 'four-mile' strategic maps and 397 'one-mile' tactical maps, there was much to be done for a basic coverage of reliable topographic maps for national development and defence. In 1947 a National Mapping Section in the Department of Interior was established and together with the Survey Corps commenced work on the 1954 Cabinet approved general purpose (national development and defence) national topographic map programme, initially the 'four-mile' map then soon after scale 1:250,000 maps (series R502).  Army agreed that when not required for solely military purposes, Survey Corps units would be available to work in the Defence priority areas in the Government approved national geodetic survey and topographic mapping programmes. This programme involved control surveys by astronomical fixes, theodolite and chain triangulation and traverse by theodolite and electro-magnetic distance measurement and all aspects of map compilation from aerial photography, final cartography and map printing.  The Corps' geodetic surveys were integrated with other Commonwealth and State Government surveys to create the NMC sponsored Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) and the associated Australian Map Grid 1966 (AMG66) of Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Australian Height Datum 1971 (AHD71). By 1968 the Corps had completed its commitment of about half of the 540 series R502 maps and it then embarked on the Defence priority part of the 1965 Cabinet endorsed national programme of general purpose scale 1:100,000 topographic maps. This programme required densification of the national geodetic and height survey networks with mapping quality control surveys of Cape York, Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia using mainly airborne electromagnetic distance measurement systems (Aerodist). The Corps completed its commitment of 862 of these maps in 1982.\n\nParagraph 10: Orlando's first win of the season came in gameweek three as FC Cincinnati visited Exploria Stadium. Tesho Akindele opened the scoring of a dominant 3–0 victory in a franchise record 31 seconds. In total, the Lions recorded 23 shots. The second goal of the game, scored by Nani chopping back on his left, sitting a defender down in the process and curling the ball into the top corner from 22 yards was voted MLS goal of the week. On May 8, Nani scored for the third consecutive game as Orlando City took the lead at home to New York City FC before João Moutinho, who had been called on as a halftime substitute to make his first appearance of the season following an injury to Ruan, conceded the game-tying penalty of a 1–1 draw. The club set a new record on May 16 with a 1–0 victory away to D.C. United as the five game unbeaten streak was the Lions' longest such run to start a season. Mauricio Pereyra scored the only goal of the game in the 7th minute. From then on Orlando defended deep, conceding shots but D.C. only registered one on target. Their frustrations eventually boiled over as home fans threw debris on to the field and players clashed in stoppage time. Hernán Losada was particularly embittered by Orlando's tactics stating: \"The way where you dominate the whole game, the opponent doesn't know what else to do to neutralize the game, to waste time, to park the bus. They didn't want to play after they scored the goal.\" The result left Orlando as one of three remaining unbeaten teams in the league. Nani retrospectively received a two-game suspension following a review by the MLS Disciplinary Committee that deemed he had made \"unwanted physical contact\" with the referee while trying to prevent further clashing between the two sets of players in stoppage time. The MLS Players Association issued a rebuke condemning the decision for \"lacking integrity.\" On May 17, it was announced Exploria Stadium would be open to full capacity in June 2021, the first time since the 2020 season opener on February 29. February signing Silvester van der Water made his first start in place of the suspended Nani on 22 May 2021. He provided his first MLS assist for Akindele on the only goal of the game and was named player of the match as Orlando beat Toronto FC 1–0 to extend their unbeaten start to the season to six. The unbeaten start to the season ended on May 29 with a 2–1 defeat on the road to New York Red Bulls. Despite the good form, Orlando struggled to hold possession and came under persistent pressure, conceding twice within an hour. The Lions looked a better goal threat following the introduction of van der Water who came off the bench to score his first goal in the 84th minute but missed a clear opportunity to equalize shortly after. The game was also notable for the senior debut of Michael Halliday who started the game, setting a new record as the youngest first-team player at 18 years, 127 days, beating Tommy Redding's record set in August 2015 by 70 days."}
{"queries": ["The Lewis River is a river in Yellowstone National Park that begins at Shoshone Lake and flows south to Lewis Lake. Boating is only allowed on a short stretch of the river.

His parents, Clive and Yvonne Flint, eventually moved to Chelmsford, Essex, where he spent his childhood in an unhappy environment and had conflicts with his parents, leading to their separation. He attended Boswells School in Chelmsford but was expelled at the age of 15. Following his expulsion, Flint worked as a roofer and became involved in the acid house music scene in the late 1980s. He was a fan of The Jam and bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees during this time.", "Phylidor, dressed in black, leads visitors into a dark room with white walls.

Arrogant, manipulative, and envious, Quico always wants to draw everyone's attention to himself, either by screaming loudly or by showing off his newest toy. Because of this, he usually gets El Chavo in trouble when he does something wrong, especially to Don Ramón, after which Don Ramón hits El Chavo angrily on the head. Partially due to his mother's influence (and former wealth and status as the wife of a naval officer), he believes that he and his mother are superior to everyone else in the neighborhood. He still finds time to play with—as he and his mother call them – chusma (\"riffraff\"), namely Chavo, Chilindrina, and Don Ramón. However, Quico has proved many times to be Chavo's best friend, often assisting him in Chavo's mischievous acts, as seen due to the fact that they are mostly seen playing together in the front yard, and that he was genuinely hurt when El Chavo left La Vecindad in the episodes \"El Ratero de la Vecindad\" and \"El Billete de Loteria\". Moreover, Quico is a good kid deep inside, even though there are several occasions in which he acts self-centered. Quico wears a rainbow-colored beanie cap, a dark blue naval officer's shirt with a red ascot, bright yellow socks he pulls all the way up to his knees, and white low-top shoes. He is also widely identified by his enormous cheeks, which he can puff out quite largely, and his minuscule intelligence, often responding to the Spanish words for idiot, stupid, dummy, etc. (he even displays delight about being called such things, oblivious to the fact that all these words are insults). Despite his stupidity, Quico displays more deceptive abilities and common sense than Chavo, and is the most likely to break the fourth wall (especially regarding that four of his quotes do this so). Often in the series Quico mentions that he has or that his mom will buy him a \"square ball\" and in \"Termina el Romance\" he and El Chavo refused to help Professor Jirafales reconcile with his mother due to Professor Jirafales having promised to them a square ball. In 1979, when Carlos Villagran quit the show, Quico is said (in the episode named \"Vámonos al Cinema?\") to have gone off to live with his rich godmother, reportedly \"unable to stand the riffraff anymore.\" No one in the show ever talked about him afterwards, or said anything about his absence, as if he had never existed. Villagran's character, Quico, starred in a rather short-lived spin-off series, ¡Ah qué Kiko! in the late 1980s, which attempted to revive the series using a \"hip-hop\" twist and gave Villagran's character a slight wardrobe make-over.\n\nParagraph 2: Among the personalities who resisted the fusion of the Lutheran and Calvinist Churches was Rev. Friedrich Meischel, who arrived in South Australia in 1860.  He had earlier been in contact with Neuendettelsau's founder, Wilhelm Löhe, and is thought by some to have been inspired by him. After Stuart's epic overland crossing from Adelaide to what later became Darwin and back again in 1862, Meischel promoted the idea of missionary work among the inland tribes, in particular the Dieri, who had helped Burke and Wills after their ill-fated attempted crossing of the continent. Meischel's dealings were largely with Revs. Christian Auricht and G.J. Rechner of the Immanuel Synod, formed after a split between the first Lutheran clergy to come to Australia, Kavel and Fritsche. A mission supported by both the Immanuel and Australian Synods was duly set up at Killalpaninna on the Cooper's Creek north-east of Marree, staffed by personnel from Harms' mission school at Hermannsburg Mission in Germany. By the time of Strehlow's graduation, missionaries were recruited from Neuendettelsau after the Immanuel and Australian Synods decided they could no longer work together, and neither could work with Hermannsburg in Germany, which had aligned itself with the state church and become \"unionist\".  A staffing crisis in 1891, in part due to disagreements between the missionaries themselves, but also conflict with the state governments where Lutheran missions were operating, resulted in Deinzer being asked for a further missionary. Strehlow was as yet unplaced with an American congregation, so was approached to fill the position of teacher at Killalpaninna, which he duly accepted, arriving in South Australia on 30 May 1892 where he was ordained at Light Pass, South Australia., reaching the outstation Etadunna on 11 July 1892, and Killalpaninna itself a day or so after.  Being split between several sites, the mission settlements here were known collectively as Bethesda Mission and within six months of arrival at the mission Strehlow learnt Dieri.\n\nParagraph 3: Death is a theme explored in the book along with the cheating of death. For Harriet, this fascination stems from her brother Robin's murder before she was old enough to know him. But this is also shown via Harriet's interest in Houdini, references to Lazarus in the Baptist church after Robin dies, Harriet's reading about Robert Falcon Scott, Harriet's practicing holding her breath to imitate Houdini's underwater tricks, and at the climax of the story, Harriet's escape from Danny Ratliff by playing dead in the water tower by holding her breath. Danny Ratliff also escapes death in the water tower - not knowing how to swim - by jumping up from the bottom of the water tower tank for two days to grab breaths of air until he is discovered. The snake-handling preacher from Kentucky, Loyal Reese, represents a form of cheating death with his numerous boxes of venomous snakes and his preaching style. In unrelated incidents, Gum Ratliff and Eugene Ratliff are bitten by those venomous snakes and both survive. Farish Ratliff is said to have survived a gunshot wound to the head earlier in his life, while he dies with the second shot to the head later in the book. Hely cheats death after releasing Loyal's venomous snakes in Eugene's office while attempting to escape unnoticed. After Harriet's great aunt Libby dies, Harriet's fascination with death becomes more intense and sad, but the author seems to reference her grandmother Edith in Harriet's behavior.\n\nParagraph 4: Graves formed Gotham Rd shortly after with Loki, JV Bastard and Paul Lifeless. Under the assumed name of Graves they recorded a five-song demo of redone Graves songs, three which were released on Web of Dharma and two other songs which had been written and demoed with the original Graves lineup but not officially released. Around this time is also when Graves announced via his website that he would begin producing other bands albums on his off time. One such band is Stressbomb from Connecticut who recorded their first album, Self Medicate, with Graves as producer and his drummer Quincy as engineer during January 2006. After a few months of the band practicing, they decided to change the band's name to Gotham Rd. They released one album before going on hiatus so Graves could join the U.S. marines. His last show ever was to be on December 31, 2004. They went on two successful tours: 2003's Seasons of the Witch tour and 2004's Mourning Lights tour. Before their Mourning Lights tour, the band entered a studio to record three new songs they had written after their first tour. Out of the three songs, only one (\"My Way\") had been mixed. The only way it was available for listening was by requesting it on Seton Hall University's WSOU, Pirate Radio. Before going on indefinite hiatus they would play one-off shows in New Jersey when home from the Punk Rock Is Dead, Graves solo tour. Their second-to-last show to date was held at the now defunct Connections in Clifton, New Jersey, in March 2005. The band announced The Nightmare Rides Are Back all over the net and played a one-time-only reunion show in Belmar, New Jersey, at the Goodwill Fire Hall with Cryptovyrus, The Zombie Mafia, Morbid Visions, and Johnny B. Morbid. They played a mix of material from Graves' solo works, Graves re-records, and Gotham Road, as well as some Misfits songs written by Graves. In 2008 and 2009, the band contributed some songs to the German compilation CDs Get Acquainted Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.\n\nParagraph 5: Flint was born in Redbridge, London, to Clive and Yvonne Flint, on 17 September 1969. Clive Flint worked as an engineering consultant. Keith Flint was initially raised in East London, but in the mid-1970s his parents moved out to a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Springfield, in Chelmsford, Essex. His childhood was described as unhappy, and he feuded with his parents, who parted when he was young. He attended the Boswells School in Chelmsford and moved to Braintree after leaving school. Flint was described as being a \"bright boy with dyslexia\" and was disruptive in class. He was expelled from school at the age of 15. Flint then worked as a roofer and later enthusiastically embraced the acid house scene of the late 1980s. Musically, Flint was a childhood fan of The Jam, and in the late 1980s he listened to bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nParagraph 6: Similar to buzz pollination, there's a species of evening primrose that has been shown to respond to bee wing beats and sounds of similar frequencies by producing sweeter nectar. Oenothera drummondii (beach evening primrose) is a perennial subshrub native to the Southeastern United States, but has become naturalized on almost every continent. The plant grows among coastal dunes and sandy environments. It has been discovered that O. drummondii flowers produce significantly sweeter nectar within three minutes when exposed to bee wingbeats and artificial sounds containing similar frequencies. A possibility for this behavior is the fact that if the plant can sense when a pollinator is nearby, there is a high probability another pollinator will be in the area momentarily. In order to increase the chance of pollination, nectar with a higher sugar concentration is produced. It has been hypothesized that the flower serves as the “ear” which contains mechanoreceptors on the plasma membranes of the cells to detect mechanical vibration. A possible mechanism behind this is the activation of mechanoreceptors by sound waves, which causes a flux of  Ca2+ into the plant cell causing it to depolarize Because of the specific frequencies produced by the pollinators’ wings, perhaps only a distinct amount of Ca2+ enters the cell, which would ultimately determine the plant hormones and expression of genes involved in the downstream effect. Research has shown that there is a calmodulin-like gene that could be a sensor of Ca2+ concentrations in cells, therefore amounts of Ca2+ in a plant cell could have substantial effects over the response of a stimuli. Due to the hormones and genes expressed in the petals of the flower, the transport of sugar into the nectar was increased by about 20%, giving it a higher concentration than compared to the nectar of flowers that were exposed to higher frequencies or no sound at all. An LDV (Laser Doppler vibrometer) was used to determine if the recordings would result in vibration of the petals. Petal velocity was shown in response to a honey bee and moth sound signal as well as low frequency feedbacks, but not high frequency feedbacks. Sugar concentrations of nectar was measured before and after the plants were exposed to sound; significant increase in sugar concentration was only observed when the low frequency (similar to bee wingbeats) and bee sounds were played. To validate that the flower was the organ sensing the vibration of the pollinator, an experiment was run where the flowers were covered with a glass jar, while the rest of the plant was exposed. Sugar concentration of nectar showed no significant difference before and after the low frequency sound was played. If petals act like the ears of the plant, then there must be natural selection on the mechanical parameters of the flower. Its resonance frequency depends on size, shape and density. When comparing the traits of plants based on their pollinators, there is a pattern between the shapes of flowers with “noisy” pollinators. Bees, birds and butterflies – the flowers they pollinate all correspond to having bowl-shaped/tubular flowers.\n\nParagraph 7: With the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, Fegelein saw active service on the Eastern Front. His unit was assigned on the 87th Infantry Division on 23 June to cover a gap in the lines of the 9th Army near Białystok. The motorized elements of the 1st SS Cavalry reached the right flank of the operational area on 24 June, but the mounted elements were unable to keep up. The exhausted horses had to be left behind and the men transported to the combat zone in lorries, while the horse-drawn artillery pieces were towed using any available vehicles. The first units to arrive crossed the Narew near Wizna and engaged the Soviets but were unable to break through. They were ordered to retreat and move further north. Infantry elements of the 87th Division captured Osowiec Fortress on 26 June, and Fegelein's cavalry was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the south-east. Himmler, unwilling to have his SS units under Wehrmacht control or used in combat other than as reserves, withdrew the SS cavalry from control of the 87th Division on 27 June. The ambitious Fegelein stressed in his reports that he believed his unit was combat ready and exaggerated its contribution to the operation. Ten of his men received the Iron Cross, Second Class for their efforts, and Fegelein was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class.\n\nParagraph 8: Bodine's career in Cup started at Watkins Glen International Raceway on August 9, 1992 when he was 28 years old. He raced the No. 34 Diet Pepsi Ford Thunderbird for Cicci-Welliver Racing, finishing 37th. It was revealed in 2022 in The Scene Vault Podcast, that though the listed owner was Cicci-Welliver, the car was in fact owned by, and the team of, Junie Donlavey of Donlavey Racing. They re-numbered Junie's car as a team \"rental\" to further the attention of Bodine's Busch Series team. Bodine revealed in the podcast that the technicality of the listed car owner was disappointing after Donlavey's death in 2014, Todd was not listed as one of \"Junie's Army\", or Junie's many Cup Series drivers, as the two were friends. His first full-time season came in 1994 when he raced for Butch Mock Motorsports.  He raced the No. 75 Ford Thunderbird sponsored by Factory Stores. He missed one race the whole season and scored two Top 5s and seven Top 10s on his way to a 20th-place position in the points standings. He was unable to match those statistics in 1995 as he finished 33rd in the points with only one Top 5 and three Top 10s. Following his release from Butch Mock, Bodine spent 1996, filling in for Bill Elliott in a four-race span, finishing 10th at Pocono. He also drove three races apiece for David Blair Motorsports and Andy Petree Racing. In 1997, he filled in for Ricky Craven at Hendrick Motorsports at Texas and for his brother, Geoff at Charlotte Motor Speedway, before he won the pole at Watkins Glen for Cicci-Welliver in a one-race deal. He finished 35th due to engine problems in that race. Todd started races for five different teams in 1997. At Loudon, he relieved Jeff Burton, who had an inner ear problem, and exited his Roush Racing car after 68 laps.\n\nParagraph 9: The Lewis River begins at the southern end of Shoshone Lake and flows southerly approximately  to Lewis Lake. This short stretch of the river is the only portion of the river where boating is permitted. The river reemerges at the southern end of Lewis Lake and flows in a general southerly direction through a steep canyon roughly paralleling the south entrance road toward the south entrance of the park. Below Lewis Lake the river passes over several cascades and waterfalls including Lewis Falls. Shortly before leaving the park, the Lewis River merges with the Snake River, changing the course of the Snake southward. The Snake soon flows out of Yellowstone into Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Lake.\n\nParagraph 10: Phylidor was dressed in black and led the visitors into a small darkened room with dazzling white walls, in which a rectangular area was fenced off with a construction of slats with a metal hand on each end. In the center of a chalk circle on the floor were a wand and a small lantern on a folded long black cloth. A container with almost burned out coals stood next to it. Phylidor asked the spectators not to speak, move or touch anything since they were surrounded by terrible dangers. He advised them to hold each other's hands and the ones on the end to hold the metal hands in order not to fall over and as a protection against the dangers. Von der Reck asked the man next to him to let go of his hand, because he suspected the metal hands could be used to give them an electric shock. Phylidor then extinguished the lantern, leaving only the very weak light of the coals. Soon thick white odorous smoke started to spread across the room and Phylidor started the ritual. It included some incantations in a dull but commanding voice with the words \"Helion, Melion, Tetragrammaton\" (as reportedly used by Cagliostro), some French sentences like \"Parois. Esprit terrible! Esprit terrible, épargne moi!\" and the name of Jehovah mixed in repeatedly. A terrible thunder-like noise filled the room and as Phylidor called out: \"Esprit, parois!\" (Ghost, appear!), a streak of light appeared on the wall that gradually transformed into the (almost) life-size figure of Voltaire, dressed in white and hovering a foot above the floor. Some spectators complained that this was a very poor apparition and clearly a projection of some transparent picture. Phylidor commanded the spirit to disappear and soon an apparition of Frederick the Great followed. When some visitors complained that the facial features weren't very clear, Phylidor replied that he was surprised that they expected to see more details in a ghost. Then Von der Eck confronted Phylidor with the question if it wasn't all just optical illusions. Phylidor threatened with terrible dangers that would be caused by this behavior. Von der Eck and other audience members then demanded to see Phylidor raise the devil, if he would still insist that he really had supernatural powers. He pleaded not to have to do this, but instead to raise the spirit of the deceased father of an Englishman in the audience as agreed upon a few days earlier. He conjured up this apparition, but the image showed a figure in too fashionable an outfit for someone who had died a few years before. In the meantime the smoke had become too irritating and some men called for light and wanted the door to be opened. Phylidor proposed to make King Heinrich IV appear, but couldn't calm his audience and accepted his defeat. Some of the men warned him that it would not end well if he was to perform his deceitful tricks again."}

It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.\n\nParagraph 2: A ruling hegumen is formally installed in a ceremony by the bishop, during which he is presented with his pastoral staff (Greek: paterissa, Slavonic: палица, palitza). Among the Russians, the pastoral staff for a Hegumen tends to be of wood (usually ebony), rather than metal. The hegumen is awarded the gold pectoral cross by the bishop, as for an archpriest. During divine services the hegumen wears a simple black monastic mantle, while the higher ranking archimandrite wears a mantle similar to one worn by a bishop (though without the white \"rivers\" along the sides, and decorated with unadorned \"tablets\" at the neck and feet). An archimandrite also wears a mitre similar to one worn by a bishop; a hegumen does not (however, in the Russian tradition, a bishop may grant an hegumen the privilege of wearing the mitre as an ecclesiastical award). A hegumen may carry his pastoral staff in processions and when giving blessings in the church (though it is never carried into the sanctuary), although it usually stands upright next to his kathisma (monastic choir stall). When outside the church, a hegumen may use a wooden walking stick similar to that used by a bishop or archimandrite, only not adorned with a silver knob.\n\nParagraph 3: In July 1960, the newly appointed Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, made an official visit to Canada (Montreal and Ottawa), requesting Francophone technical assistance for his country, however financial assistance was turned down by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.  During the ensuing Congo Crisis, about 1,800 Canadians from 1960 to 1964 served among the 93,000 predominantly African peacekeepers with the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), working chiefly as communications signallers and delivering via the Royal Canadian Air Force humanitarian food shipments and logistical support.  The Canadian participation stemmed more from overwhelming public opinion, and not decisive action on the part of the Diefenbaker government, according to historians Norman Hillmer and Jack Granatstein.  However, Diefenbaker reportedly refused to comply with numerous public calls for Canada to provide humanitarian relief to 230,000 Congolese famine victims in South Kasai in 1961 ostensibly because \"surplus foodstuffs should be distributed to unemployed persons in Canada\" as a first priority.  Two Canadians died from non-conflict-related causes, and, out of the 33 Canadians injured in the conflict, twelve received \"severe beatings\" by the Congolese forces.  Although Patrice Lumumba dismissed the first incidences of these beatings, on August 18, 1960, as \"unimportant\" and \"blown out of all proportion\" in order for the UN to \"influence public opinion\", he attributed them a day later to the Armée Nationale Congolaise's \"excess of zeal\".  Historians have described these incidents as cases of mistaken identity under chaotic circumstances, in which Canadian personnel were confused by Congolese soldiers with Belgian paratroopers, or mercenaries working for the Katanga secession.  Only a quarter of Canada's signallers extended their six-month tours of duty to a full year, and Canadian forces reportedly found the Congolese to be \"illiterate, very volatile, superstitious and easily influenced\", including an instance where a Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel successfully persuaded Kivu Province's Prime Minister to accept a relief contingent from Malaysia by explaining to him that the Malaysians were capable of diverting bullets in flight away from their intended path.  A recent study concluded that while the Canadian government \"demonstrated a greater willingness to accommodate the Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba than other Western nations\" and publicly did not side with either faction, it \"[p]rivately [...] favoured the more Western oriented [President] Kasavubu\".  Canada's troops earned the trust of Joseph Mobutu, the latter visiting Canada in 1964 as leader of the Congolese National Army, during which he acknowledged Canada's support in maintaining his country's territorial integrity.\n\nParagraph 4: On April 12, 2010 a contingent of former AAA wrestlers including Histeria, Psicosis II, Maniaco, El Alebrije and Cuije appeared on a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) show in Puebla, Puebla. The group drown into the arena in a black SUV and attacked La Sombra, El Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara after they just finished wrestling. Brazo de Plata, Místico and Jon Strongman tried to help out but were kept away by CMLL rudos Averno, El Texano, Jr. and El Terrible. Following the attack the former AAA wrestlers returned to the SUV and left the arena. The group made several subsequent attacks during CMLL shows, including running in during their Sunday Night Arena México show, indicating that the storyline was not limited to just the Puebla area. After weeks of run-ins the group, dubbed Los Independientes or \"The Independents\" after the Independent circuit, wrestled their first match for CMLL. In their debut for CMLL on April 26, 2010 El Alebrije, Histeria and Psicosis defeated El Hijo del Fantasma, La Mascara and La Sombra. On May 10, 2010, during a match between Los Independientes and CMLL wrestlers former CMLL and AAA wrestlers Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000 ran in to help Los Independientes beat up on their opponents, taking their side in the storyline between independent wrestlers and CMLL. The team was later renamed Los Invasores. During a trios match between El Alebrije, Histeria II and Maniaco and the team of Héctor Garza, Brazo de Plata and Toscano, Garza turned on his team mates and joined Los Invasores. On May 16, 2010 Psicosis wrestled against La Sombra in a match that saw the surprise appearance of both Mr. Águila and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. Mr. Águila returned to CMLL to side with Los Independientes while Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. ended up siding with CMLL in their war against the outsider group. The following day in Arena Coliseo Olímpico returned to CMLL and attacked Máximo during the main event of the show, at the time it was not clear if he had actually joined the group of outsiders or not. CMLL later held a press conference announcing that they would hold a special Sin Salida event on June 6, 2010 that would center around the Los Invasores vs. CMLL storyline. During the press conference Olímpico was part of the Invasores group. It was also announced that Garza and Mr. Águila were the co-leaders of the group. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show Histeria participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was La Sombra, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, El Alebrije and Volador Jr., Último Guerrero and Averno. La Sombra and Histeria was the first team to escape the match. In the end Místico defeated El Oriental to unmask him. Histeria was one of 12 men who put their mask on the line as part of a 12-man steel cage match in the main event of the 2010 Infierno en el Ring. He ended up in the final four of the match, but instead of supporting fellow rudo Doctor X he left the cage to save his own mask for the second time that week. In the end Ángel de Oro defeated Fabián el Gitano in the Lucha de Apueta (bet match) portion of the match to unmask him. On August 16, 2010 it was announced that Histeria was one of 14 men putting their mask on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas steel cage match, the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show. Histeria was the fifth man to leave the steel cage at the same time as his fellow Invasor El Alebrije, keeping both their masks safe. Both Histeria and El Alebrije returned to the cage to help their partners but were eventually removed by officials. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him.\n\nParagraph 5: The story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai), an amoral samurai and a master swordsman with an unorthodox style. Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim who he finds praying for death. He appears to have no feeling. Later, he kills an opponent in self-defense in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal, but became a duel after he raped his opponents wife in exchange for throwing the match and allowing her husband to win. His opponent finds out about the rape prior to the match, and is shown giving his wife a notice of divorce. His rage at Ryunosuke during the match causes him to take an illegal lunging attack after the judge proclaims a draw, and Ryunosuke, the better swordsman, parries and kills him with one stroke of his bokken. Ryunosuke flees town after killing the man, and cuts down many of the dead opponent's clansmen who attack him as he is leaving. His opponent's ex-wife asks to go along with him.\n\nParagraph 6:  A different variation of the character appears in Gotham, portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia. This version is Jason Skolimski (using an alias Jason Lennon), a son of unnamed mother and Jacob Skolimski, the butler who worked for rich woman Constance van Groot. His biological mother left Jacob and Jason some time ago. When they came to service of Constance van Groot, Jason thought to believe that she is his mother, but she rejected him and in his rage killed her, taking her money and leaving the rotting corpse in her bedroom, with the help from his father. Jason made plastic surgery to his disfigured face in the clinic, where he was cured by a nurse Julie Kemble, the first murder victim. Over one decade, he became a serial killer in which he targets young and attractive successful women, kidnapping and keeping them for weeks or months and later murdering and dumping them in various places of Gotham, leaving behind a hand-made drawing of a broken heart. The GCPD keeps very quiet about the case, not even telling the press about his killings, and usually let the cases slip by because whenever Skolimski finds out his murders are being investigated, he goes after the loved ones of the detectives handling them. From those reasons, he is called the \"Ogre\" and \"Don Juan Killer\" (according to Harvey Bullock), and the Ogre is said to be handsome, rich and educated man in his profile. First appearing in \"Beasts of Prey\", Gordon and Bullock investigate the murder of missing model Grace Fairchild after Gordon accepted the case from police officer Len Moore; Gordon later realises that he was ordered by Commissioner Loeb to give him the case as an act of vengeance. In \"Under the Knife\", Gordon publicly tells to the public the details about him and his murder spree. He and Bullock discover his background and his father. During that time, Skolimski encounters Gordon's ex, Barbara Kean, inviting her in his house. Although he attempts to kill her, he saw something more in her, but Barbara tries to resist, forcing him to bound her in torture room. After freeing Barbara, Jason forces her to tell him whom to kill next. In \"The Anvil or the Hammer\", Gordon tries to find him, through the Foxglove club in which one member Sally (who was kidnapped by Jason before his murder spree, only to be spared by unknown reason) reveals that he is in Gotham Royal Hotel. Gordon and Bullock then go to Barbara's parents mansion, finding her parents murdered. Gordon finally shoots him and saves Barbara, albeit in shaken psychological state.\n\nParagraph 7: Bianca's rape was heavily debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as \"punishment\" for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others felt that it realistically captured what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, executive director of the organization, responded that they had \"some concerns\" about [the storyline] and \"that the broader context of the [daytime television] genre kind of needs to be taken into account.\" Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the \"actual process\" GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. \"There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots,\" Garry relayed. \"We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children.\" Garry continued, \"So it's basically community feedback, as well as some of our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense.\"\n\nParagraph 8:  but may have been the first gang in the city. The members were made up of recent Irish immigrants from County Kerry, Ireland. There was also a 19th-century Philadelphia gang of the same name. Beginning in the 1820s, the Kerryonians were part of the first wave of the early New York gangs, following behind the first and oldest gang in the city, the Forty Thieves, to occupy the Five Points area. The Kerryonians were particularly fond of targeting New Yorkers who were of British descent. The Kerryonians also fought a gang named the \"Pelters\". They are most known however for disrupting British actor William Charles Macready's performance at Astor Place around 1825. The Kerryonians were eventually absorbed into the growing street gangs of Five Points such as the Dead Rabbits, Roach Guards, and Chichesters.\n\nParagraph 9: In Christianity, the term \"unconditional love\" can be used to indicate God's love for a person irrespective of that person. This comes from the concept of God sending His only Son, Jesus Christ down from heaven to earth to die on a cross in order to take the punishment for all of humanity's sins. If someone chooses to believe in this, commonly called \"The Gospel\", then Jesus' price on the cross pays for their sins so they can freely enter into heaven, and not hell. The term is not explicitly used in the Bible, and advocates for God's conditional or unconditional love, using different passages or interpretations to support their point of view, are both encountered due to the different facets of God's nature. The cross is a clear indicator of God's unconditional love in that there is no way to earn one's way to heaven, one must simply believe. In all other religions cited below, there is a conditional striving to achieve a sense of unconditional love, based on one's own efforts and understanding. In Christianity, it all depends on Jesus, not the person's effort nor understanding. A passage in scriptures cites this \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—\" Ephesians 2:8,9, NIV. God's discipline can be viewed as conditional based on people's choices, but His actual love through Jesus is unconditional, and this is where some may become confused. His salvation is a free gift, but His discipline, which is shaping of good character, can look more conditional. Ultimately, knowing God and free passage to heaven have already been supplied by a God of unconditional love, one can simply choose to believe in order to receive such love. The civil rights leader and Pastor, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was quoted as saying \"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality\".\n\nParagraph 10: After his football career, he worked as the technical director of the National Team for Hungarian Football Federation. He left the federation and became the club manager (CEO) of SIÓFOK FC 2002-2004 . They promoted to first league in the first year and finished 5th position in top league next season. Although the successful seasons, the club got into financial crisis when the owner couldn't finances the club anymore. Sallói made a new business plan, releasing the expensive players and build a young team with a young coach, Aurel Csertoi. They finished the first part of the league in first place causing big surprise for everyone. Seeing his success with small club, Újpest FC, one of the biggest and most popular team in Hungary, offered him the CEO position in winter break and he took the job. Újpest FC started the second part of the league in 8th position without head coach who resigned in winter break. Sallói again, give the job to a young coach, Geza Meszoly who made excellent job with his team, winning the second part of the league and finished the 2nd place in the table at the end of the season. In 2005, when new owner arrived to the club, Sallói resigned. He moved to Diósgyőri VTK to a very popular team which was year by year in financial crisis. For that time Sallói was called in Hungary 'man who can manage the financial crisis'. He did the job again, stabilized the club and madeDiósgyőri VTK a stable mid table team. End of 2007, the new owner of Ujpest FC called him back to Újpest FC as a sport director. His task was to build a team who can win the league. Újpest FC finished in 2nd place after a year and made over 1 million euros profit on transfer fees. End of 2009, he joined to Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club as an Eastern Europe scout. 2011 Sallói returned to Hungarian football and took a job in Kecskeméti TE as sport director until 2015. From July 2015 after Kecskemeti TE lost the licence for the Hungarian professional leagues, he signed for Dunaujvaros PASE as the sport director. In 2018 he became the sport director of the second league club Zalaegerszegi TE In the first season the team promoted to the first league after 7 years.

He held racist views during his university years, believing that Jews were an inferior race that could only overcome their weaknesses through assimilation and intermarriage with Germans and Slavs. However, in the early 1900s, Ruppin's perspective changed, and he embraced his Jewish identity.

The family moved to Magdeburg when he was 11, and there followed a period of slow decline in the family's prosperity. A fifteen, his family's poverty forced him to leave school, where he was regarded as an extremely gifted pupil, in order to work to support them. Though he disliked commerce, he proved to be an extremely able merchant in the grain trade. Nonetheless, he was able to complete his studies in law and economics, and came second place in a prize competition established by the Krupp Steelworks concerning the uses of Social Darwinism in industry. While at the university, Ruppin accepted the crude racial views of his age, including the idea that Jews were an inferior race, whose liabilities as a group could only be overcome by assimilation, outbreeding with Germans and Slavs. By the early 1900s, however, he began to think of himself as a Jew and take a more positive view: Jews could be regenerated not by outbreeding with Slavs and Germans, but rather by reconstituting themselves as a separate nation, as Zionism proposed. As he confided to his diary at this time, Zionism or complete assimilation: tertium non datur.\n\nParagraph 3: In Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU) in 2007, Martinez began teaming with Angel Orsini. In March 2008, they began feuding that culminated in many grueling matches throughout 2008 into 2009, including a Steel Cage on January 10, 2009; 2 months later, Martinez defeated Orsini in a Bullrope match on March 7, 2009 at the Second Anniversary Show in Boonton, New Jersey to win the WSU Championship, ending Orsini's record reign of just over nine months. They had one more match that rewrote the record books in a 60-minute Iron Woman Match on June 6, 2009 in Boonton, New Jersey, that went a total of 70 minutes including going 10 minutes into sudden death and resulted in Mercedes getting the pin after a fisherwoman's buster and retaining the title. Martinez would continue to defend the title against the likes of Nikki Roxx, Awesome Kong, Rain, and Portia Perez. Along the way, Martinez and Orsini briefly captured the WSU Tag Team Championships. Martinez continued her WSU Championship title reign by defending against more challengers including Alicia, Amber O'Neal, Mickie James, and Jazz throughout 2009–2010. In January 2011, Martinez defeated Angel Orsini again in a ladder match to unify her title with Orsini's All Guts No Glory championship. Martinez then successfully defended her championship against Serena Deeb in the main event of WSU's 4 year anniversary show and also defeated Brittney Savage at WSU's Uncensored Rumble event. In August 2011, Mercedes put her title on the line against Uncensored Rumble winner, Lexxus in a match that would become the longest women's wrestling match in history as the match continued past the 60 minute time limit until Martinez was able to get the win after 73 minutes, breaking the record of the Orsini match by three minutes. Martinez then became involved in a violent rivalry with Jessicka Havok that culminated in Havok putting an end to Martinez's unprecedented three year title reign at the WSU 5th Anniversary Show.\n\nParagraph 4: The Celynen Collieries' Institute (1908) and Memorial Hall (1925) on High Street, are both listed buildings, the Memo being Grade II*. The Institute is unusual as the miners themselves built it, borrowing the money through a private mortgage. The Memo was built to commemorate the 75 Newbridge men who died in the First World War. It is still the focus of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday activities every year. The Memo contains a ballroom with a sprung dance floor and an art deco auditorium which was designed to be both a theatre and a cinema. Both buildings now provide community facilities for local groups and societies, live music and community events but are both in urgent need of repair. After the mines closed, the Institute & Memorial Hall lost its income and became a drinking club. In 2004, when the local council was considering purchasing the land for a car park, a public meeting called by local MP Don Touhig led to the formation of The Friends of Newbridge Memo who got the buildings onto the BBC2 programme Restoration. They narrowly missed winning the final but received assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund to begin the long process of raising money to restore both buildings. After a development grant was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in summer 2009, Cadw and Caerphilly County Borough Council are actively supporting the scheme and the Big Lottery awarded £500,000 in December 2009. In July 2010 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery would grant the project £2.9 million to restore the buildings.\n\nParagraph 5: Big outsider Tremallt led the field over Melling Road and towards the first fence, where The Bunny Boiler unseated its rider and was the only casualty. The next fence saw Bramblehill Duke fall when chasing the leaders. At the third fence which was the first open ditch, Wonder Weasel was the only faller in mid division . Tremallt continued to lead the race over the fences before Becher's Brook. At Becher's Brook, Fadalko overjumped the fence and unseated its rider. Meanwhile, last year's winner Bindaree blundered and was on his nose after jumping the fence. The field all managed to jump the Foinavon fence well and ran on towards the Canal Turn. At this fence, Polar Champ blundered and unseated its rider when behind. Montifault joined Tremallt at the front of the race while jumping Valentine's Brook. 10/1 shot Chives blundered at the eleventh fence which was another open ditch and was pulled up before the next after breaking a blood vessel. At the next fence, another fancied horse Youllneverwalkalone jumped it slow and was immediately pulled up lame. Leading up to The Chair, Gunner Welburn had become the race leader. However the horse hesitated before jumping the fence and nearly unseated its rider. Katarino unseated its rider Mick Fitzgerald after making a mistake at The Chair and Ballinclay King was pulled up at the rear of the field. The next fence which was the Water Jump saw Iris Bleu pulled up. Thirty horses were still left standing when they continued the race onto the second circuit. All horses jumped the next two fences safely, at the 19th fence (open ditch) Monty's Pass and Torduff Express joined Gunner Welburn in the lead. Maximize fell, Ad Hoc and Goguenard both blundered and unseated their riders. You're Agoodun and Robbo were both hampered and unseated their riders also. Good Shuil was pulled up after tailing off at the same fence. At Beecher's Brook second time round Killusty fell in mid division and Burlu when behind for most of the race, while at the rear of the field the favourite Shotgun Willy pulled up as was Empereur River.  Gingembre was pulled up well behind at the Canal Turn. At the next fence which was Valentine's Brook, Mantle's Prince made a mistake and unseated its rider and Red Ark was pulled up at the fence towards the rear of the field. At the 27th fence final open ditch of the race Torduff Express had weakened, blundered and unseated its rider as did Red Striker. Cregg House refused the fence after tailing off . A group of Gunner Welburn, Monty's Pass, Amberleigh House and Montifault pulled away from Supreme Glory and the rest of the field as they crossed Melling Road to jump the final two fences. Monty's Pass jumped the last two fences ahead of Amberleigh House and a weakening Gunner Welburn. On the run-in Supreme Glory seemed to be staying on well after overtaking Amberleigh House just before the elbow. Although Monty's Pass stayed on well to go clear and win the race by 12 lengths ahead of Supreme Glory in 2nd and Amberleigh House in 3rd. Gunner Welburn and Montifault finished 4th and 5th after making a lot of the running in the race. Bindaree stayed on well to finish 6th after spending most of the race towards the rear. Next to finish was Carberry Cross, Blowing Wind, Tremallt, Behrajan, Djeddah, Majed, Royal Predica and last to complete was Southern Star. 14 horses completed the race.\n\nParagraph 6: The Flint Journal was founded in 1876 during Flint's booming lumber years by Charles Fellows and Washington Irving Beardsley as a weekly newspaper The Journal's main competitors at the time were the Wolverine Citizen, The Genesee Democrat and The Flint Globe. The paper was sold in rapid succession to Doctor Carman, who sold ownership in December 1882 to George McConnolly and others until the Journal was purchased by the Flint Globe's owner, Howard H. Fitzgerald, and merged as the Weekly Globe and Daily Journal. The Booth Publishing Company, owned by Ralph H. Booth of Detroit, along with his brothers George and Edmund,  purchased ownership of the Weekly Globe and Daily Journal in 1911. In 1919, the Journal had a paid circulation of 25,947, giving it the 4th largest paid circulation of any evening newspaper in the state.  By the early 1920s, the Journal had not only consolidated with the Globe but also the Flint Daily News. In July 1922, the Journal entered the field of radio broadcasting, becoming partners with local broadcaster Frank D. Fallain to put Flint's first station, WEAA, on the air. The newspaper was known as the Flint Daily Journal until 1935, when its name was shortened to the Flint Journal.\n\nParagraph 7: Rodney Hatch, a barber, is engaged to Gloria Kramer. While visiting an art museum, he feels drawn to a sculpture of Venus the Roman goddess of love, though the other patrons dismiss it as out of step with the current art trends. On a whim, Rodney puts his engagement ring on the statue's finger, causing the statue to come to life. Venus falls in love with Rodney for giving her life and begins pursuing him, causing turmoil in his relationship with Gloria. When Venus becomes annoyed with Gloria, she transports her to the North Pole. Adding further complications, with the statue gone from the museum, Rodney is arrested for art theft, but Venus helps him escape. Rodney begins to fall in love with the goddess, but their time together is cut short when she is called away by the gods, and becomes a statue again. When Gloria returns from the North Pole she is furious with Rodney and breaks off their engagement. Rodney returns to the museum and looks at the statue again. He unexpectedly bumps into a young woman from out of town who bears a striking resemblance to the statue. Rodney leaves the museum with her, and as she starts to tell him her name he responds 'You don't have to tell me. I know.'\n\nParagraph 8: In September 1952, a CIA intelligence report noted the difficulty in continuing to support the Tibetan resistance when the Chinese Communist government and the massive People's Liberation Army (PLA) fully occupied the country. As a result of this Chinese domination over the Tibetans, direct diplomatic relations between Tibet and India ceased. A daily Hindi newspaper reported that this move had ended 16 years of direct contact between the governments of India and Tibet. India was able to have direct communications until that point because China's authority in Tibet was still limited. In the final paragraph of the article, the newspaper writes, \"The Chinese occupation of Tibet a year ago has changed this relationship. The cause was inevitable, and India had no choice but to accept this arrangement because the Chinese Communists now have complete control of the foreign affairs of Tibet\". Previously, India had provided a link for United States' support to the Tibetan resistance. Later that year (December 1952), the CIA produced an Information Report (Classification: Secret) containing two items in the subject line: 1) Anti-Communist Activities, Tibet, and 2) Chinese Communist Activities, Tibet. The document shows that the agency was closely scrutinizing both Tibetan and Chinese groups and individuals at the time, as well as any other obtained intelligence. The report defines the anti-Communist Tibetan People's Party and identified geographic areas where the Party's support was strongest. A 36-year old leader, Lhopto Rimpochhe was named as the leader of the \"warrior monks.\" The document goes on to report on intelligence regarding a petition sent to the Chinese authorities in Lhasa by Ragashar Shape, Tibetan Defense Minister, that went ignored. The Shape petition included the following points: the Dalai Lama should continue to rule unchallenged; monastery estates should not be confiscated; Tibetans should thank the Chinese for liberation but kindly ask them to leave and, in return, the Tibetan people would never ask for military assistance from the Chinese; and persuading the Chinese to \"please buy the [Tibetan] wool.\" The document then proceeded to provide intelligence on various undesired actions taken by the Chinese including forcing the Dalai Lama to give a  speech the threat of death, kidnapping over 200 children for the purpose of retraining them (one was even beheaded as a warning to the others not to cry and complain), and the installation of a puppet governor at Kham. Next, the document listed nine names of Tibetans acting as informers against the Chinese. Lastly, Chinese forces in Tibet were addressed—numbers of troops, names, and leadership transition information.\n\nParagraph 9: Raised in a musical family, Hudson attended Boys Town School in Kingston, where he organized school concerts with schoolmates including Bob Marley, Delroy Wilson, and Ken Boothe. He was an ardent follower of Coxsone Dodd's Downbeat sound system and was soon hanging out with musicians such as Don Drummond, carrying his trombone into sessions at Dodd's Brentford Road studio when he was around fourteen. He first release circa 1969 was \"Shades of Hudson\" by DJ Dennis Alcapone on his own Inbidimts label, using a rocksteady track that had been recorded a few years before. After leaving school he served an apprenticeship in dentistry, and used these skills to raise money for recording sessions. In the same year he obtained some Termites and Carl Bryan rocksteady rhythms from Olympic Records, and recorded new vocals over them, such as \"Old Broom\" and \"You Must be Popular\". These early 45s on his own Imbidmts and Rebind labels enjoyed sufficient success to enable him to purchase some studio time of his own. His first recording session produced Ken Boothe's Jamaican hit \"Old Fashioned Way\", later versioned by Dennis Alcapone as \"Spanish Omega\" and U Roy as \"Dynamic Fashion Way\". In the following months he worked with vocalists Delroy Wilson (\"Run, Run\"), Alton Ellis, Bunny Gale and John Holt (\"Never Will I Hurt My Baby\"). He was one of the first to record DJ U-Roy in 1969, although U-Roy's first recording had in fact been made with Peter Tosh for Lee Perry – \"Earth's Rightful Ruler\".  Other deejay productions included numerous tunes with Dennis Alcapone (e.g. \"Shades of Hudson\"), and Big Youth's \"S.90 Skank\" released in 1972 became the deejay's biggest hit, with added motorcycle noises recorded in the studio beginning a trend followed by other producers such as Dodd and Perry. In the first half of the 1970s he regularly used the Soul Syndicate band, featuring George \"Fully\" Fullwood and Carlton \"Santa\" Davis.\n\nParagraph 10: Legend has it that clan names and the matrilineal kinship system came from a response to issues that arose during the Haudenosaunee mourning process. Prior to clans being created, the entire Oneida village would mourn after the death of a village member. This caused problems as important decisions were put on hold during the time of mourning. Village leaders were at a loss as to how to continue everyday life while at the same time observing traditional mourning practices. A young village member approached the leaders with a possible solution.  He suggested sending three female elders to the nearby river and having them build a fire and spend the night. At first light the following morning the women were to pray to the Creator and take notice of the first animal that approached the river. Once the women had seen an animal, they were to report back to the village leaders. The elders put the young man's plan into action. Three women were sent to the river. Upon their return one woman reported that she had seen a turtle at the edge of the river. The second woman reported seeing a wolf running along the river. The third woman stated that she had seen a bear feeding in the river along the rocks. Following the reports of the women, village leaders named the Oneida clans the Turtle, Wolf and Bear clans. They determined that a village member's clan would be passed through the mother's line from generation to generation, as women have the Creator's gift to create life.  The Oneida Nation is still a matrilineal kinship society. After the clans were established, the people developed their practices for a mourning process. When there was a death in the village, the clan members of that person would mourn. The members of a second clan would console them, and the members of the third clan would carry on village business as usual."}

Studies indicate that the mechanism involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. The drug or metabolite binds to a host protein to form a non-self epitope, which is then presented to T cells by antigen-presenting cells. This can lead to an attack on the body's own tissues. However, the ability of a drug to induce AGEP is limited to individuals who express specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes targeted by the drug.

He then shows Lisa a hologram of the prom, and tells her love can be painful; she agrees, noting she broke up with Milhouse and he had an Incredible Hulk-style meltdown. Lisa suggests that to get Jenda back, he must show her he can provide for her. Bart decides to take Lisa's advice and gets a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. While delivering groceries to Mr. Burns, he rescues him from a robbery by Snake Jailbird. As a reward, Burns gives Lisa's scholarship to Bart. He accepts it, seeing it as a way to get Jenda back. He then tells Lisa about the scholarship causing present and future Lisa to both get angry at Bart. Bart reconciles with Jenda, and now has a good future. That night, Jenda again wants to have sex with Bart, but then he goes into Professor Frink's basement and sees Lisa's bleak future with Milhouse on Frink's machine. Jenda is furious at Bart (she notes she never had any problems sparking romance with Todd Flanders), and gives him an ultimatum: leave and they are finished. Bart does head out and saves Lisa from accepting Milhouse's dismal proposal, then tells his sister he is giving her scholarship back and will find a woman who loves him for himself. Professor Frink then tells present Bart he will get one at age 83, then die one minute later, and his brain would be buried in a pauper's grave.\n\nParagraph 3: Writers ensured that the couple would encounter many roadblocks throughout their relationship. In November 2020, Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times revealed that Harlow would be experiencing stress at school and that Hendrix would steal exam papers and send them to Harlow in an attempt to help her. Hughes described it as Harlow's future being \"in ruins thanks to her boyfriend\" and revealed that Harlow would be implicated for the situation. This leaves Harlow to explain herself and convince others that it was not her fault. Four months later, Hendrix becomes involved in an illegal gambling ring and member Natasha Leighton (Sam Healy) forces her wrath upon Harlow by kidnapping her after Hendrix busts the ring. In the aftermath, Harlow is \"shaken\" and \"torn\" on what to do, but thinks it would be \"best to end the relationship, leaving Hendrix heartbroken.\" Although Hendrix attempts to impress Harlow, she doesn't think it would be good to rekindle their relationship. Turland told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, \"My honest reaction is that I was quite upset! I do enjoy the relationship between Hendrix and Harlow. We've had a lot of fun building that up ever since I started in the show, as there's always been a chemistry there.\" Turland continued, \"It was upsetting because it was such a familiarity on set and it turned into a beautiful relationship. But it was also exciting to work with Jemma on this storyline. I think Neighbours viewers have learned to love the relationship, so it'll come as a bit of a shock to people. I don't think they'll be too happy to start with. But there's not much you can do to come back from Hendrix's behaviour. He has stuffed up quite a bit, so it's quite reasonable for Harlow to pull the pin. I'm keen to see how people react as the break-up scene was quite upsetting.\" He also gave hints to a possible reunion of the pair, saying, \"Harlow has become a huge part of Hendrix's life and a huge part of his choices. He chose to stay in Erinsborough and not go with his dad because of Harlow, so he truly loves her and will always have a soft spot for her. I think there's definitely potential for a reunion.\" Donovan also revealed that she was \"sad\" to see the relationship come to an end, but would \"definitely\" remain \"open-minded\" about Harlow's future relationships.\n\nParagraph 4: AGEP also differs from the other SCARs disorders in respect to the level of evidence supporting the underlying mechanism by which a drug or its metabolite stimulates CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Studies indicate that the mechanism by which a drug or its metabolites accomplishes this stimulation involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. A drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related epitope. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) takes up these proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) component of their major histocompatibility complex (i.e. MHC) (APC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the T-cell receptor on CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DR proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to attack self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may also stimulate T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope, bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope, or bypass the APC by binding directly to a T cell receptor. However, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA serotypes to stimulate T cells and the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them. Since a SCARs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes, their ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or metabolite. Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop SCARs in response to a particular drug on the basis of their expression of HLA serotypes. Studies have identified several HLA serotypes associated with development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in response to various drugs which elici these disorders, developed tests to identify individuals who express these serotypes, and thereby determined that these individuals should avoid the offending drug. HLA serotypes associated with AGEP and specific drugs have not been identified. A study conducted in 1995 identified of HLA-B51, HLA-DR11, and HLA-DQ3 of unknown serotypes to be associated with development of AGEP but the results have not been confirmed, expanded to identify the serotypes involved, nor therefore useful in identifying individuals predisposed to develop AGEP in response to any drug. Similarly, a specific T cell receptor variant has been associated with the development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN but not AGEP.\n\nParagraph 5: The next day, the SPC issued a Moderate risk for central Mississippi and portions of Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee. This included a large 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes, and a smaller 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes across northern Mississippi. Throughout the late afternoon and evening, multiple supercell thunderstorms developed. Hail and winds battered Mississippi, and several EF1 tornadoes caused minor to moderate damage in rural areas of the state. After sunset, the event rapidly escalated into a significant outbreak as the intensifying supercell thunderstorms pushed into Alabama, and significant tornadoes began touching down. An EF2 tornado near Belgreen snapped many trees and injured one person when a house was damaged and shifted on its foundation. Two EF2 tornadoes moved through Winston County and heavily damaged or destroyed multiple homes, mobile homes, and outbuildings, and also snapped numerous trees and power poles near Arley and Double Springs. An EF2 tornado touched down over Monte Sano Mountain in eastern Huntsville, snapping and uprooting many trees, and damaging numerous homes as it passed through several subdivisions, a few of which had roofs torn off. A horse riding arena was also destroyed by the Huntsville area tornado. An EF3 tornado passed near the towns of Danville and Neel, causing major structural damage to industrial buildings, homes and a fire station. A motorcycle shop was leveled, vehicles were tossed, and several mobile homes were completely destroyed as well. At around midnight and into the very early morning hours of November 30, the storms moved into northeastern Alabama and southern Tennessee. A powerful EF3 tornado ripped directly through the town of Rosalie and to the north of Ider, killing four people and injuring nine others. The Rosalie/Ider tornado destroyed homes and mobile homes, churches, and businesses along its path. A shopping plaza in Rosalie was leveled by the tornado, and a daycare center near Ider was reduced to a bare slab. Further to the north, strong tornadoes were impacting communities in Tennessee, including an EF3 that severely damaged the town of Ocoee. The Ocoee post office and fire station were destroyed, two people were killed in town, a cell phone tower and a metal truss tower were knocked down, and 20 people were injured. A high-end EF2 tornado struck Athens, destroying several businesses and manufactured homes, heavily damaging a large church complex, and injuring 20 people. A few homes sustained major structural damage and a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed by another high-end EF2 tornado that passed near Whitwell and Dunlap. After sunrise, additional weaker tornadoes touched down in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. This included several brief tornadoes that caused minor to moderate damage in and around Atlanta. A high-end EF1 downed many trees and damaged numerous homes in Simpsonville, South Carolina as well before the outbreak came to an end.\n\nParagraph 6: Las Ranas and Toluquilla were the two largest prehispanic cities to develop in the Sierra Gorda area. Las Ranas was the most developed city from the 7th to the 11th century, with Toluquilla somewhat smaller and reaching its height in the 11th century. Both cities are near to each other and both controlled the active trade routes of the area as well as the mining of cinnabar, highly prized as a red pigment in Mesoamerica. The trade that passed through the area linked the Gulf of Mexico to the central Mexican Plateau and some areas north as well. Extensive mining was done at both Toluquilla and Las Ranas beginning between 200 and 300 CE, extracting cinnabar, mercury and sulfur. Cinnabar was the most prized used in funerals. The structures at the sites indicate a stratified society and built with stone slabs and mud and covered in stucco in some places. At Toluquilla, many structures were built on terraces cut into the mountain to create more space. Las Ranas was taken over by the Chichimeca Jonaz late in its history but by the time the Spanish arrived, both cities were abandoned. In 2009, INAH and other institutions carried out research at Toluquilla on thirty skeletons from the pre Hispanic era in order to determine the importance of mining in the south of the Sierra Gorda. The objective of the study was to determine the amount of accumulation of mercury in the bones to find out who was most involved in the mining and how it affected the health of the population. It also studies patterns of mercury contamination in the surrounding environment as well. There have been over eighty extraction sites for cinnabar found around Las Ranas and Toluquilla, which lie on one of the largest deposits of the mineral in Mexico.\n\nParagraph 7: Later, on Cyrus's request, ‘Amr sent ten officers led by Ubadah ibn al-Samit. When Cyrus saw Ubadah, who was black, he exclaimed 'Take away that black man: I can have no discussion with him.' But the Arabs explained that Ubadah was one of their most trusted leaders, that ‘Amr had personally commissioned him, and that they treat black men equally. Ubadah then explained 'There are a thousand blacks, as black as myself, among our companions. I and they would be ready each to meet and fight a hundred enemies together. We live only to fight for God, and to follow His will. We care nought for wealth, so long as we have wherewithal to stay our hunger and to clothe our bodies. This world is nought to us, the world is all.' Moved by his piety, Cyrus turned to his companions and said 'Do you hear this? I much fear that God has sent these men to devastate the world,' and then to Ubadah 'I have listened, good sir, to your account of yourself and your comrades, and I understand why your arms so far have ailed. I know too that the Romans have failed by caring overmuch for earthly things. But now they are preparing to send against you immense numbers of well-armed battalions. Resistance will be hopeless. But for the sake of peace, we will agree to pay sum of money at the rate of two dinârs a head for every man in the Arab army, a hundred dinârs for your commander, and a thousand for your Caliph, on condition that you return to your own country.' Ubadah replied, 'Do not deceive yourselves. We are not afraid of your numbers. Our greatest desire is to meet the Romans in battle. If we conquer them, it is well; if not, then we receive the good things of the world to come. Our prayer is for martyrdom in the cause of Islam, not for safe return to wife and children. Our small numbers cause us no fear; for it is written in the Book, 'Many a time hath a small company overcome a great host, by the will of God.\" Understand, therefore, that we can accept no terms save one of the three conditions which we are ordered by the Caliph to offer you.'\n\nParagraph 8: A precursor to the present cathedral was built in 1250, and was replaced with a stone church in 1333 by Grand Duke Ivan Kalita, who would later become the first Russian monarch to be buried in the church.  In 1505, Grand Duke Ivan III, already in the midst of major renovation project for the Kremlin, turned his attention to the church, as in the case of the rebuilding of the Assumption Cathedral two decades earlier, turned to architects from Italy for assistance.  An Italian, Lamberti Aloisio da Mantagnana (Aloisio the New) was invited to Moscow, and ground was broken for a new cathedral on 21 May 1505. Ivan died in the autumn of the same year, and was buried in the still unfinished building. Work on the cathedral was completed by the end of 1508, but it was not formally consecrated until 8 November 1509.\n\nParagraph 9: The Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II, at the beginning of the Pacific War in December 1941, was the third most powerful navy in the world, and the naval air service was one of the most potent air forces in the world. During the first six months of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy enjoyed spectacular success inflicting heavy defeats on Allied forces, being undefeated in every battle. The attack on Pearl Harbor crippled the battleships of the US Pacific Fleet, while Allied navies were devastated during Japan's conquest of Southeast Asia. Japanese Navy aircraft operating from land bases were also responsible for the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse which was the first time that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway. In April 1942, the Indian Ocean raid drove the Royal Navy from South East Asia. After these successes, the Japanese now concentrated on the elimination and neutralization of strategic points from where the Allies could launch counteroffensives against Japan's conquests. However, at Coral Sea the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia while the defeat at Midway saw them forced on the defensive. The campaign in the Solomon Islands, in which the Japanese lost the war of attrition, was the most decisive; they had failed to commit enough forces in sufficient time.\n\nParagraph 10: During summer and fall 1791, Maria and Hamilton continued the affair while Hamilton's wife, Eliza, and their children were in Albany, visiting her parents. A short time into the affair, Maria informed Hamilton that her husband had sought a reconciliation with her, to which she agreed without ending the affair with Hamilton. She then obtained an interview for James Reynolds, who applied to Hamilton for a position in the Treasury Office, which Hamilton refused. After Hamilton had shown unequivocal signs that he wanted to end the affair on December 15, 1791, Maria sent him a letter warning of Reynolds's anger over the supposed discovery of the affair:I have not the time to tell you the cause of my present troubles; only that Mr. Reynolds has wrote you this morning and I know not whether you have got the letter or not and he has swore that if you do not answer, or if he does not see or hear from you today, he will write to Mrs. Hamilton. He has just gone out and I am alone. I think you had better come here one moment that you may know the cause, then you will the better know how to act. Oh, my God, I feel more for you than myself and wish I had never been born to give you so much unhappiness. Do not respond to him; not even a line. Come here soon. Do not send or leave any thing in his power. From December 15 to December 19, 1791, Reynolds sent threatening letters to Hamilton, and after a personal meeting instead of seeking redress from dueling, he asked for financial compensation. Hamilton complied, paying to Reynolds the requested $1,000 and discontinuing the affair, as he had wished to do for some time. However, on January 17, 1792, Reynolds wrote to Hamilton inviting him to renew his visits to his wife. Maria, most likely manipulated into the scheme, also began to write to Hamilton whenever her husband was out of the house and seduced him anew. After each of these exchanges, Reynolds would write to Hamilton under the guise of being friends, and Hamilton would, in return, send $30. Hamilton's last \"loan\" of the $50 to James Reynolds, and possibly the end of the affair, dates in June 1792. "}
{"queries": ["The band released three vinyl-only EPs in 2000, followed by their debut album in March 2001. The album's title, \"If You Happy with You Need Do Nothing,\" was inspired by a letter from the lead singer's dentist. Although the album consisted of previous EPs and new songs, it was promoted as their debut. The band wanted to record the album from scratch, but their label refused to finance studio time. They released a new version of a single in September 2001, but had to cancel a gig in December after their guitarist was electrocuted during a soundcheck.", "The text describes the events leading up to a failed attack during World War I. The divisional artillery focused on cutting wire while heavier guns aimed to destroy enemy strongpoints. General Haking believed that the enemy was disorganized and that the British had enough firepower to win decisively. However, the bombardment did little damage and General Haking insisted on lifting heavy guns from the front line before the attack. This decision went against advice from General Haig. Haking believed that high explosive fire would disperse British gas and wanted to give the Germans a chance to retreat. The attack was poorly planned and executed, leading to a report being sent to the Prime Minister.", "In the film, David Byrne wears a large business suit called the \"big suit\" during the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by traditional Japanese theater styles and became an iconic symbol not only in the film but also for Byrne himself. Byrne explained that the idea for the suit came from a fashion designer friend who suggested that everything is bigger on stage, and he applied this concept to a businessman's suit. Film critic Pauline Kael described the suit as a perfect fit psychologically, comparing it to the costumes in Noh plays and the large suit of felt by artist Beuys. Byrne himself explained that he wore the big suit to make his head appear smaller, as he believed that music is a physical experience that the body often understands before the mind."], "answers": ["Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 5", "Paragraph 4"], "context": "Paragraph 1: André tells Hélène that his only hope of salvation is for her to find the fly, identifiable by the fact that its head is completely white, so that he can transmit himself with it again in the hopes of regaining his missing atoms. A search of the house proves fruitless, and in desperation Hélène begs him to go through once more in the hopes that the transformation might reverse itself. Not believing it will work, but wanting to humor her, he agrees and goes through. He trips when he steps out of the receiver, and the cloth he has been covering his head with falls off. Hélène screams. His accident had switched his head and arm with that of a fly, and this last experiment mixed in parts from the missing cat. Now realizing that he has been transformed beyond all hope, André destroys the pods and all of the work in his lab and devises a way to commit suicide while at the same time hiding from the world what he had become. He shows Hélène how to operate the hydraulic press and then places himself under it. Obeying his last wish, Hélène pushes the button to lower the press and kills her husband. François goes to see Hélène the next day but receives heartbreaking news. Unable to live with her memories, she committed suicide by cyanide during the night. Later that evening François invites Inspector Charas, the policeman in charge of the case, over to his house for dinner. After finishing their meal, François allows him to read Hélène's manuscript. After reading it, Charas declares that Hélène must have been mad, and they both decide to destroy the \"confession\". But just as the story ends, François tells Charas that earlier that day he killed a fly and buried it at his brother's graveside. It was a fly with a white head.\n\nParagraph 2: The band released 3 vinyl-only EP's on the label through 2000, the self-titled debut in February, second \"Bookends\" in August and third \"Montevideo\" in November. They released debut album, If You Happy with You Need Do Nothing in March 2001. Explaining the origin of album title, Gorton revealed that \"It actually comes from when I was in my old flat and my dentist had changed hands, and I had this Asian dentist who wrote a letter in pidgin English saying 'oh I'm gonna be your new dentist now, if you wanna use your old dentist you have to do this, but if you happy with you need do nothing' and it was in brackets and it was like 'Wow.' So we kept that because it suits what we do\". Although the album is technically a compilation of the previous EPs plus new songs Umlaut and 2 Up 2 Down, it is largely considered to be the band's debut and was promoted as such. The band had wanted to record the album afresh, but as Twisted Nerve were unwilling to finance studio time the band were forced to use the existing recordings. In September 2001, the band released a newly recorded version of You Make No Bones as a single. In December 2001, the band were forced to pull out of a gig in Glasgow after guitarist Ian Smith was electrocuted during the soundcheck after he touched a microphone whilst some equipment had reportedly short circuited. He was treated as a local hospital for shock and burns to his hands.\n\nParagraph 3: Bach composed the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, shortly after he first performed his St John Passion, for the First Sunday after Easter, called . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, \"our faith is the victory\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples, first without then with Thomas, in Jerusalem (). The unknown poet begins with a verse from the Second Epistle to Timothy, \"Remember that Jesus Christ … was raised from the dead\" (). The poet sees Thomas as similar to the doubtful Christian in general, whose heart is not at peace. The center of the cantata is the Easter hymn \"\" (The glorious day has appeared) by Nikolaus Herman (1560), praising the day of the resurrection. In contrast, movement 5 recalls the danger by the enemies, until in movement 6 Jesus appears, as he did to his disciples in Jerusalem, finally bringing peace. The line \"\" (Peace be with you) is repeated four times, framing three stanzas of a poem. The closing chorale is the first stanza of \"\" (Thou Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ) by Jakob Ebert (1601).\n\nParagraph 4: The film includes Byrne's \"big suit\", an absurdly large business suit that he wears for the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by Noh theatre styles, and became an icon not only of the film – as it appears on the movie poster, for instance – but of Byrne himself. Byrne said: \"I was in Japan in between tours and I was checking out traditional Japanese theater – Kabuki, Noh, Bunraku – and I was wondering what to wear on our upcoming tour. A fashion designer friend (Jurgen Lehl) said in his typically droll manner, 'Well David, everything is bigger on stage.' He was referring to gestures and all that, but I applied the idea to a businessman's suit.\" Pauline Kael stated in her review: \"When he comes on wearing a boxlike 'big suit' – his body lost inside this form that sticks out around him like the costumes in Noh plays, or like Beuys' large suit of felt that hangs off a wall – it's a perfect psychological fit.\" On the DVD he gives his reasoning behind the suit: \"I wanted my head to appear smaller and the easiest way to do that was to make my body bigger, because music is very physical and often the body understands it before the head.\"\n\nParagraph 5: On 10 and 12 October, divisional artillery concentrated on wire cutting whilst heavier guns concentrated on destroying enemy strongpoints. Haking persuaded himself that the enemy were \"shaken and disorganised\" (\"little more than wishful thinking\" in Lloyd's view) and that enough artillery and gas was now available to win a decisive victory (in the event the bombardment did little damage to the German positions). Once again Haking gave a series of highly optimistic speeches to the attacking brigades. However, on the day of the attack, and apparently at Haking's insistence, the heavy guns were again \"lifted\" from the German front line an hour before the 2pm attack, leaving them to be bombarded only by shrapnel – a tactic used by the Guards Brigade earlier in the battle. Haking ignored advice from Haig (on the telephone on 28 September) to suggest that this had been a bad idea, although in accordance with Army doctrine at the time Haig once again delegated the decision to Haking as the \"man on the spot\". Haking appears to have thought that High Explosive fire might disperse British gas (although gas was, this time, being used as an adjunct to the attack rather than a decisive weapon in itself), but he also wanted to give the Germans \"a chance to run away\". Stuart-Wortley, GOC 46th Division, was under Haking's command for the attack. He later complained that he and his troops had been \"hurried into the trenches\" with barely enough time \"to become acquainted with the actual position\". Haking overruled his wish to launch a careful step-by-step attack, telling him that he would \"reach Fosse 8 without firing a shot\". In Lloyd's description Haking was \"seriously misleading the troops under his command\" or else \"simply ignorant\". The attack went so badly that Lt-Col J. C. Wedgwood MP sent a report to the Prime Minister.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1855 Helper wrote the book The Land of Gold. Reality versus Fiction, in which he said \"that slave labor was less profitable than free labor and in Baltimore, where the book was to be published, he had run into a Maryland statute, dating from 1831, which made it a felony with a penalty of not less than ten years in jail knowingly to write or print anything 'having a tendency to excite discontent ... amongst the people of color....' Compelled to excise these comments, Hinton Helper — an irascible man — resolved to speak out his whole mind in a book devoted entirely to this subject.\" The book was The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It. Expressing Helper's deep opposition to slavery and the condition of Southern culture and the South's lack of economic progress, it was one of the most effective criticisms of the South. Helper argued that the South's growth, prosperity, and cultural development were being held back by slavery. He deployed statistics from the census to show that land values, literacy levels, and manufacturing rates were considerably lower in the South than in the North. He warned of the devastation caused by slavery through deforestation. He proposed that slaveholders be taxed to colonize all free blacks in Africa or Latin America.\n\nParagraph 7: SAREC is a regionally sponsored program that goes by the name Eastern Africa: “Urban Origins in Eastern Africa”. This program pursued archaeology on Zanzibar during four seasons, 1989-1993. During this time a great deal of excavation and recovery was done at a scale much larger than preceding visits. Due to the different regions in this site regarding typography the site was divided up in to numerous areas assigned by letters covering 410m² and examining 11,500m² of sifted deposits. Area A is 2 x 1 x 1.7m large and nine layers were identified. Layer 2 at 9–30 cm deep Sgraffiato pottery with incisions and blue white porcelain bowl fragments were found. Layer 4 at 40–70 cm deep, revealed imported pink pottery sherds of Sgraffiato and green monochrome, these dated to 1430-1650 A.D. Layer 5 at 70–86 cm deep other pottery was found but white stoneware from the Tang dynasty was found, dated to 618-908 A.D. Layer 6 at 86–100 cm deep produced many blue-green pottery sherds and charcoal samples tested to be from 600-770 A.D. The next layers show evidence of pottery and it is not until Layer 9 (1.42-1.17 cm) that they discovered a grave with two individuals, with suggested dates of 1440-1600 A.D. Most of these area sites are similar and a few stand out as yielding significant finds. Unit B in Layer 3 (30–50 cm deep), brown fabrics along with blue-green glazed ware, and a fragment of olive-green glazed Chinese stoneware. Layer 4 (5–66 cm deep), notable items are Changsha stoneware, poly-chrome ware from the Islamic period and what appears to be six copper coins. There were also more copper coins found in Layer 6. Layer 8 produced Changsha painted stoneware from 700-800 A.D. Layer 11 (135–165 cm deep) had provided rare thin walled pink earthenware. In Layer 14 & 15 (185–270 cm deep) had early pieces of glass. Units C-E discoveries were mostly sherds and charcoal, but at 21 cm deep in Unit C a portion of a grindstone was unearthed. Units F-I discoveries. Unit J at 35–44 cm deep have way to a fragment of a Longquan green celadon bowl from the Mind dynasty dating to the 14th -16th century. Layer 6 at 55–64 cm deep provided 4 small silver coins. Layer 12 at 91–131 cm deep revealed “Susa ware” fabric from the 7th century. Layer 14 at 131–141 cm deep showed evidence of late Roman period, late 5th century. Unit K at Layer 8 had a juvenile’s skeleton, at 50–60 cm deep.\n\nParagraph 8: Many of the Native American warriors came from the Fort Sill Reservation in Indian Territory, confident that they could terrorize Texas and escape to safety across the Red River, which was another legal jurisdiction. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors, approx 180 warriors, under the leadership of Satanta, Satank, Mamanti, Big Tree, White Horse, Fast Bear, Yellow Wolf, and Eagle Heart. Hidden in a thicket of scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, they observed the slow approach of General William Tecumseh Sherman's inspection retinue of approx 18 men.  Although the Kiowa war party outnumbered the  US Army troop by ten to one, they didn't attack, maybe because the Army troopers would have inflicted too many casualties. The Kiowa story is that the previous night, Mamanti (\"He Walking-above\"), the shaman, had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. The braves were rewarded three hours later when 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder trundled into view. The Kiowa attacked and quickly overwhelmed this convoy. Seven muleskinners were killed, while five managed to escape. One of the mule skinners was tortured to death with fire by the Kiowa, his tongue cut out. The Warriors lost three of their own but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. It was well after dark before the white survivors reached the nearby Fort Richardson and told their harrowing tale to the very officer whose party had passed unharmed under the Kiowa guns, William Tecumseh Sherman. General Sherman ordered the arrests of the Indian war chiefs at Fort Sill.  Satank was killed in the train as he tried to escape the column of United States soldiers. The rest were tried in the first Indian trial in history. Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. They were paroled two years later thanks to the steady behavior adopted by Guipago in his dealing with the government agents, and were sent back to their people.\n\nParagraph 9: When a request is made for a JHTML page, e.g. \"index.jhtml\", the request for this page is forwarded from the HTTP server to another system running a Java application server. The JHTML page is compiled first into a .java file and then into a Java .class file. The application server runs the code in the .class file as a servlet whose sole function is to emit a stream of standard HTTP and HTML data back to the HTTP server and on back to the client software (the web browser, usually) that originally requested the document. The principal benefit of this system is that it allows logic running in Java on the application server to generate the HTML dynamically. Often a database is queried to accumulate the specific data needed in the page.\n\nParagraph 10: Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal (known as Ratchet & Clank 3 in Europe and Africa and Ratchet & Clank 3: Up Your Arsenal in Australia) is a 2004 3D platform video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the third installment in the Ratchet & Clank series and was released in North America on November 2, 2004. Shortly after it was released in Japan on November 25, when the first volume of the Ratchet & Clank manga, drawn by Shinbo Nomura, was released. A demo of this game was included in the PAL release of Sly 2: Band of Thieves. The game introduces Dr. Nefarious, a robotic villain."}

Astral, despite not suffering from Dwarfism, was shorter than average wrestlers. He won the Mini-Estrella division in the 2009 CMLL Bodybuilding contest and made his wrestling debut shortly after. Astral participated in various tournaments and matches, including the Torneo Bicentenario where the winner would be promoted to compete in the regular division. Astral also competed in a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament, where losing teams advanced and faced the risk of losing their masks or hair. Astral later wrestled for the vacant Distrito Federal Lightweight Championship, won his first title in a rematch, and became the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion in 2014. He successfully defended the title six times before 2017.", "This text discusses the career of Dr. Henri Stiller, a physician and medical entrepreneur known for his work in organ transplantation. Despite having a busy personal life with a wife and six children, Stiller was incredibly prolific in his research and advocacy, publishing over 265 peer-reviewed scientific papers. He was also an early adopter of computerized patient records and co-created a telephone-based medical service, which became the first form of Telemedicine offered by the Government of Ontario. Stiller's deep commitment to the success of organ transplantation led him to establish the Multi-Organ Transplant Service and the Canadian Centre for Transplantation in London, where he served as chief from 1984 to 1996. He played a key role in the development of Cyclosporine, a drug used to prevent transplant rejection, and was part of a team that discovered that Type I Diabetes was an autoimmune disorder. Stiller's achievements in the field were widely praised and he published a book about organ transplantation in 1990."], "answers": ["Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 9", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Courtois served as the historical consultant on the controversial 1985 documentary Des terroristes à la retraite, which alleged a conspiracy by the PCF leadership to betray the FTP-MOI resistance group to the French police in 1943. The film accused Boris Holban of betraying Missak Manouchian to the Brigades spéciales. In his interview in the film, Courtois stated: \"From summer 1943 on, the Communist Party clearly sought to affirm its superiority within the resistance. To that end, and to reinforce its prestige, it had to have bombings and other armed attacks to publicize. In Paris there was only one group available to carry out such attacks: the foreign combatants. The party leadership had the option of keeping them safe or keeping them in the fight. That was what happened, and we can safely say that they were sacrificed to serve the higher interests of the party\". The documentary set off an intense debate in France known as L’Affaire Manouchian. During the affaire, Courtois reversed his position. In the 1989 book Le sang de l'étranger - les immigrés de la MOI dans la Résistance co-written with Adam Rayski and  Denis Peschanski, Courtois cleared Holban of the allegation that he was a police informer and concluded that it was \"brutally efficient police work\" by the Brigades spéciales that led to the mass arrests of the FTP-MOI members in November 1943.  ''Le sang de l'étranger had a major impact on the historiography of the French resistance as the book established the majority of the attacks on German forces in the Paris area between April 1942-August 1944 were the work of the FTP-MOI, which had ignored by historians until then in order the make the Resistance appear more French.\n\nParagraph 2: Receiving no reply to her note, which Wayland had lost, Amy found her way the next morning to a grotto in the gardens, where she was discovered by Elizabeth, who had just told her host that \"she must be the wife and mother of England alone.\" Falling on her knees the countess besought protection against Varney, who she declared was not her husband, and added that the Earl of Leicester knew all. The earl was instantly summoned to the royal presence, and would have been committed to the Tower, had not Amy recalled her words, when she was consigned to Lord Hunsdon's care as bereft of her reason, Varney coming forward and pretending that she had just escaped from a special treatment for her madness. Leicester insisted on an interview with her, when she implored him to confess their marriage to Elizabeth, and then, with a broken heart, told him that she would not long darken his brighter prospects. Varney, however, succeeded in persuading him that Amy had acted in connivance with Tressilian, and in obtaining medical sanction for her custody as mentally disordered, asking only for the earl's signet-ring as his authority. The next day a duel between Tressilian and the earl was interrupted by Dickie, who produced the countess's note, and, convinced of her innocence, Leicester confessed that she was his wife. With the queen's permission he at once deputed his rival and Sir Walter Raleigh to proceed to Cumnor, whither he had already despatched Lambourne, to stay his squire's further proceedings.\n\nParagraph 3: \tFrom those early years in the 1970s through to the first decade of the twenty-first century, Stiller would set a hectic pace for himself of work, research, advocacy and medical-based entrepreneurship. His name can be found on some 265 peer-reviewed scientific papers, which is an astonishing level of published research for a physician who, along the way, had married the former Angie Apolinario, had a family of six children, a full case-load of patients, and held numerous administrative responsibilities. Additionally, Stiller had found the time to be an early adopter of computerized patient records, as well as to co-create a telephone-based medical service, which he would take public. This service became the first form of Telemedicine offered by the Government of Ontario.4  These foundational years of his career, especially the pioneering days of organ transplantation, were very exciting, he says, but also hard-going emotionally because a large number of transplant recipients died. Still, ‘some of my best memories’, he recalls, ‘are of driving home at two in the morning from the ICU after a family had agreed to donate a loved one’s organs, and knowing that someone facing imminent death was being prepped for the OR’.5  A deep and abiding commitment to the eventual widespread success of organ transplantation led to Stiller's establishing the Multi-Organ Transplant Service and the Canadian Centre for Transplantation in London, over which he acted as chief from 1984 until 1996. Organ rejection was (and remains) a major challenge in the field and Stiller's key involvement as principal investigator in the early 1980s in the clinical trials and market development of the drug Cyclosporine for use as a first-line therapy for transplant rejection stands as a towering achievement in revolutionizing the success rate of organ transplants worldwide. In 1990, he published the book, Lifegifts: The Real Story of Organ Transplantation, in which he, along with his brother, the Rev’d Brian Stiller, recounts this remarkable history.6  In a similar way, Stiller's leading role amongst a team of researchers had proved in 1984 that human Type I Diabetes was an autoimmune disorder and therefore amenable to a regime of immunosuppressant or immunomodulant treatment. It was a singular breakthrough that was much-praised by the medical community, as well as by many others, including the late Professor Michael Bliss, the renowned University of Toronto medical historian and biographer of the Nobel prize-winning co-discoverer of insulin, Sir Frederick Banting.7\n\nParagraph 4: Chaminade College Preparatory School is an independent, Roman Catholic school, of the Marianist Order, for boys in grades six through twelve in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. The school is located in Creve Coeur, in west St. Louis County, Missouri. The school offers 7-day, 5-day, and temporary boarding. Students come from throughout the United States and from countries throughout the world. Canning Hall, the name of the dormitory, accommodates up to sixty-five residents. The school bears the name of Father William Joseph Chaminade, a priest who lived during the era of the French Revolution and who founded the religious order known as the Society of Mary (Marianists). The school maintains an active relationship with the Society of Mary through governance structures and the employment of lay and religious Marianists and maintaining this charism.\n\nParagraph 5: While in New York, Blyden again worked in radio and studied acting at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting for eighteen months. While starring in a showcase of The Importance of Being Earnest, he was spotted by director Joshua Logan who cast him in a small role in the Broadway production of Mister Roberts. He was then cast in the larger role of \"Ensign Pulver\", and remained with the production until 1951. His second Broadway role was that of \"Schmutz\" in the original production of Wish You Wish Here.  In 1958, Blyden replaced Larry Storch as \"Sammy Fong\" in the out-of-town tryouts for the musical Flower Drum Song. He remained in the role during the show's original Broadway run for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The show was choreographed by his then-wife, Carol Haney. That same year, he appeared in You Can't Take It with You, at Expo 58 (also known as Brussels World's Fair).\n\nParagraph 6: 2008 proved to be Van Barneveld's most barren year thus far in the PDC in terms of success, with him not winning a major tournament. His defence of the World Championship crown was seriously thwarted by a bout of flu. He managed to win his first two matches comfortably, although he nearly had to retire during his second-round match due to breathing problems. He was defeated by Kevin Painter in the 3rd round by 4 sets to 2. Following this, he reached the semi-finals of the 2008 Premier League Darts, but was defeated for the third consecutive year at this stage of the tournament, defeated by James Wade. He was also knocked out of the early stages of the US Open, the Las Vegas Desert Classic by Alan Tabern and in the semi-finals of the UK Open by Gary Mawson, after having defeated rival Taylor by 10 legs to 9 a round earlier. He was also defeated in the quarter finals of the World Matchplay by Wayne Mardle, despite leading 12 legs to 7 at one stage. However, Van Barneveld did regain some form in the World Grand Prix reaching the final of the tournament, before being defeated by Taylor by 6 sets to 2. He then lost to Lewis in the quarter-finals of the inaugural European Darts Championship in November losing by 9 legs to 2.\n\nParagraph 7: In 284 BC he was one of the ambassadors to Tarentum, successfully keeping peace, and was elected consul in 282 BC where he saved the Greek city Thurii from the Lucanians. After the Romans were defeated by Pyrrhus at Heraclea, Fabricius negotiated peace terms with Pyrrhus and perhaps the ransom and exchange of prisoners; Plutarch reports that Pyrrhus was impressed by his inability to bribe Fabricius, and released the prisoners even without a ransom. Fabricius was consul a second time in 278 BC, and once again successful against the Samnites, Lucanians and Bruttians. He also defeated Tarentum's army after Pyrrhus' departure from Italy to Sicily.\n\nParagraph 8: Primal Quest is an expedition adventure race that has been called one of the most difficult athletic events in the world and was cited as the most prestigious expedition event in North America. Co-ed teams of four trail run, mountain bike, kayak, climb, rappel and mountaineer all while navigating all under their own power. The race has been in existence since 2001 and has been successfully revived following the loss of adventure racer Nigel Aylott. Each race lasts up to ten days, with winning teams completing the course in approximately six-eight days. The race once featured the largest prize purse in adventure racing.\n\nParagraph 9: Astral competed in the 2009 CMLL Bodybuilding contest and won the Mini-Estrella's division coming in ahead of a number of competitors who were already working for CMLL. Days later, on November 28, Astral made his wrestling debut teaming up with Fantasy to defeat Pequeño Nitro and Pequeño Universo 2000 in a tag team match. While being classified as a Mini-Estrella Astral did not suffer from Dwarfism, but instead was merely shorter than the average wrestlers, something not uncommon in Lucha libre. As part of CMLL's bicentennial celebrations, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Mexico's independence CMLL held two Torneo Bicentenario tournament one of which was for the Mini-Estrellas division. The winner of the tournament would be \"promoted\" to compete in the regular division going forward. The tournament took place over three Sundays in August, from August 10 to 24. To qualify for the finale on August 24 a wrestler would have to win an eight-man Torneo cibernetico to outlast his competitors. Astral competed in the second block of the tournament, but was eliminated by Pierrothito. Astral was one of 16 Mini-Estrellas to compete in a Ruleta de la Muerte, (\"Roulette of Death\"). In a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament tag teams face off in a single elimination tournament, but unlike traditional tournaments it is the losing team that advances in this case. The team that loses the tag team match final must immediately wrestle against each other in a Lucha de Apuestas match, where either their mask or their hair is on the line. Astral teamed up with Pequeño Violencia in the fight to keep their masks safe. In the first round they lost to the team of Eléctrico and Mercurio, in the second they were defeated by Pequeño Black Warrior and Fantasy, which put them in the finals of the match, where the losing team would have to risk their mask or hair. Astral and Pequeño Violencia managed to defeat Pierrothito and Bam Bam to keep their mask and hair safe. On April 15, 2012 Astral wrestled Demus 3:16 for the vacant Distrito Federal Lightweight Championship, a title only defended in Mexico City and not exclusively for Mini-Estrellas, but wrestlers under a certain weight limit. The more experienced Demus 3:16 defeated Astral to win the vacant title. CMLL held the 2012 Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament, with Astral being one of the 18 competitors. Astral was eliminated as the sixth competitor by Demus 3:16. After unsuccessfully challenging Demus 3:16 for the vacant Distrito Federal Lightweight Championship he was more successful in his rematch, winning his first title as he defeated Demus 3:16 on an independent wrestling show in Mexico City. On November 6, 2012, 12 competitors met in a steel cage match where the loser of the match would be forced to unmask or have his hair shaved completely off. Astral was the sixth person to exit the cage when he tried to perform a Moonsault of the top of the cage onto Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were on the floor. Due to the cage mesh breaking earlier in the match, Astral got caught up on the cage and landed awkwardly on the three men on the floor. The bad fall caused Astral to be rushed out of the arena for immediate attention and Mercurio had to be carried to the back as well due to the impact of Astral. On April 6, 2014, at Arena Coliseo's 71st anniversary event, Astral won a ten-man minis steel cage Lucha de Apuestas, forcing Pequeño Halcón to unmask. On September 7, Astral defeated Pequeño Olímpico to win the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship for the first time. Between 2014 and 2017 Astral was booked to successfully defend the CMLL World Mini-Estrellas Championship six times, defeating Eléctrico, Demus, Mercurio twice Auron and finally Demus for a second time.\n\nParagraph 10: Photoelectrolysis of water, also known as photoelectrochemical water splitting, occurs in a photoelectrochemical cell when light is used as the energy source for the electrolysis of water, producing dihydrogen which can be used as a fuel. This process is one route to a \"hydrogen economy\", in which hydrogen fuel is produced efficiently and inexpensively from natural sources without using fossil fuels. In contrast, steam reforming usually or always uses a fossil fuel to obtain hydrogen. Photoelectrolysis is sometimes known colloquially as the hydrogen holy grail for its potential to yield a viable alternative to petroleum as a source of energy; such an energy source would supposedly come without the sociopolitically undesirable effects of extracting and using petroleum."}

In 1964, Cohen visited Amsterdam and befriended writer Simon Vinkenoog, who would later translate Cohen's writings into Dutch. In 1974, Cohen visited again after an unsuccessful visit to Paris and involvement in filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky's film Dune. During this visit, he was accompanied by Simon Vinkenoog, poet Louise Landes Levi, and publisher Gerard Bellaart. Cohen's most continuous period in Amsterdam began in 1978 when he met Caroline Gosselin and started the Bandaged Poets project. He also reconnected with Eddie Woods and became a contributing editor for Ins & Outs magazine. Cohen and Gosselin lived in Amsterdam for three years and Cohen made several return visits afterward.

The purpose was to mine this data, under encrypted identifiers generated by the country's Data Protection Authority, to identify genetic variations associated with diseases and to use that information to develop new drugs. As of 2018, more than 160,000 people had contributed DNA and detailed health information to the company's research into the inherited components of common and rare diseases. deCODE has published hundreds of discoveries in cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's and other central nervous system diseases, many types of cancer, and dozens of other conditions and traits. Now an independent subsidiary of Amgen, deCODE has provided novel targets now in clinical development and provides human genetics validation across a range of therapeutic areas. In 2018, Stefansson made good on a promise that the company would launch a website that enables Icelanders to request the analysis of their sequence data to determine whether they carry a SNP in the BRCA2 gene that has been linked in Icelanders to significantly increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. More than 10% of the population has used this portal, and the country's national health system has increased clinical testing, counseling and treatment to take advantage of this information for public health.\n\nParagraph 3: Mount Gay Rum is named for Sir John Gay Alleyne, 1st Baronet of Four Hills. He was a trusted friend of John Sober, who purchased the Mount Gilboa Plantation/Distilleries from William Sandiford in 1747.  Sir John Gay Alleyne agreed to become the manager of the company at John Sober's request. Sir John Gay Alleyne was so effective at leading the company, and earned such a widely respected reputation internationally as a business manager and community leader, that the company was renamed in his honour after his death in 1801 at the proposal of his longtime friend John Sober, whose estate benefited greatly over the years under Sir John Gay Alleyne's effective management. As there was already a Mount Alleyne in existence on the island of Barbados, the company was renamed Mount Gay Distilleries, incorporating the beloved Sir John Gay Alleyne's middle name. In 1757, Sir John Gay Alleyne was elected to the Parliament of Barbados, for the Parish of St. Andrew, a seat he held for the next forty years, with only a break in 1771. He became Speaker of the Barbados House of Assembly in 1767, serving until 1770 and after another two years was reappointed until 1779. Alleyne was named a Baron of Four Hills on 6 April 1769. According to Hilary Beckles, historian and principal of the University of the West Indies – Cave Hill Campus, Sir John Gay Alleyne was a popular leader among the planter elite and a great philanthropist. He was also one of the most influential voices of his time to speak out against the institution of slavery. On 29 April 2010, while speaking at the Founder's Day service at Alleyne School, which was founded by Sir John Gay, alumnus and guest speaker Monsignor Vincent Blackett stated that Sir John Gay Alleyne should certainly be named one of Barbados' National Heroes.\n\nParagraph 4: Controls are the core of the Beehive framework. A control can be defined as a program which can be used by the developer to access enterprise-level resources such as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), web services etc. For example, consider accessing an old legacy EJB 2 bean. It involved a lot of routine code like getting access to a home interface, then creating/finding an EJB using finder methods and then accessing the remote methods of the bean. Using a control simplified this because it did most of the routine coding for the developer, who could work on business logic rather than the inner-details of Java EE technology. This is also useful to advanced developers because the developer could concentrate on more useful things like constructing a Facade to a complex set of application APIs. In essence a control to a legacy EJB 2 bean ensured that the developer could simply use the control and call any business method of the EJB, using it in the same way as any other Java class. When EJB 3 came around, such simplification was already provided by the EJB specification itself, and Beehive controls were of little further use here. The Controls come with a standard set of controls wiz EJB Control, Webservice Control, Database Control and JMS Control. Custom controls can also be developed which in turn could make use of the controls already built-in.\n\nParagraph 5: The Lake Causeway (Calzada del Lago in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as Via 5. The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about  wide and was raised  above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just  wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately  high and varied from  wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure  east-west by  north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished talud walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nParagraph 6: In early 1964, Cohen visited Amsterdam (during the same trip up from Tangier when he arranged for the printing of Gnaoua in Antwerp, Belgium). He befriended writer Simon Vinkenoog, who would later translate many of Cohen's writings into Dutch. Ira was also in Amsterdam in 1974, having visited Paris and the filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky with an intention to involve his partner, Petra Vogt, in Jodorowsky's forthcoming film Dune. Unfavorably received, he traveled to Amsterdam, again in the company of Simon Vinkenoog, Louise Landes Levi - poet, musician & translator with whom he would later collaborate on many projects – and Gerard Bellaart (Cold Turkey Press - Rotterdam, publisher of Burroughs, Bailes, Pound et al.), who became Ira's first publisher in the West & a lifelong friend, as was Levi. However his most continuous Amsterdam period began in the spring of 1978. It was then that he met Caroline Gosselin, a French girl who was making and selling life masks at the Melkweg (Milky Way) multimedia center. She and Cohen expanded this into Bandaged Poets - a series of papier-mâché masks of dozens of well-known poets that he subsequently photographed. He also reconnected with Eddie Woods, whom he had first met in Kathmandu in 1976. Woods, who co-founded Ins & Outs Press with Jane Harvey, was preparing to launch Ins & Outs magazine. Cohen's work appeared in every issue and he regularly served as a contributing editor. He performed at the first of Benn Posset's long-running One World Poetry festivals, P78. Cohen (and Gosselin) lived in Amsterdam for the next three years; and even after leaving he made several return visits to the city, often staying for long spells. Ins & Outs Press, which had already published postcards of the Bandaged Poets series, produced three limited-edition Kirke Wilson silkscreen prints of the photographs, including those of William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. His film Kings with Straw Mats was also edited, in collaboration with Ira Landgarten, at Ins & Outs. In September 1993 Cohen returned to Amsterdam from New York to participate in a Benn Posset-organized tribute to Burroughs, along with Woods, the American writer William Levy, the German translator & publisher Udo Breger, and others.\n\nParagraph 7: Between 1976–77 and 1981–82 Albert Rovers played in the League of Ireland.  In September 1976 Albert Rovers were elected to the league as replacements for Cork Hibernians. The team was managed by Noel O'Mahony and they made their League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers at Flower Lodge on 3 October 1976. Albert Rovers had requested the game be moved to avoid a clash with the Cork Senior Hurling Championship final but Shamrock Rovers refused. The visitors won 2–1 with Larry Wyse and Mick Leech scoring their goals. The 1977–78 season saw the League of Ireland team adopt the name Cork Albert and for 1978–79 they became Cork Alberts. As Cork Albert the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a second time in 1977–78, defeating Limerick in the final. They were finalists in the 1977–78 League of Ireland Cup but lost out to Dundalk on penalties. England international Bobby Tambling finished his playing career with Cork Alberts while John Meyler also played for the club during this era. Following the demise of Cork Celtic in 1979, the club was Cork city's sole representative in the League of Ireland and the team adopted the name Cork United for the 1979–80 season. The club retained the Cork United name for the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. Cork United managed to sign some notable players including Miah Dennehy, Ian Callaghan and Ian Hutchinson but they never managed to make the move beyond mid-table. As Cork United the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979–80 and 1981–82. In the finals they defeated Crosshaven and Waterford respectively. In December 1981 the club invested heavily in bringing Manchester City to Turners Cross for a friendly. Hampered by postponements and cancellations, the club slipped into debt and they were unable to pay Manchester City their £8,000 appearance fee. As a result, they were subsequently expelled from the League of Ireland.\n\nParagraph 8: Democrats and academics largely opposed the bill, citing the unclear language and government interference in situations handled by educational boards. Many criticized it as an effort to frighten professors away from controversial topics or discussions, pointing out an overhanging threat of lawsuits would stifle discussions. Eleanor Sobel (D-Hollywood), who voted against the bill in the Choice & Innovation Committee, called it \"the antithesis of academic freedom\". Dan Gelber (D-Miami Beach) pointed out the potential for abuse by students who believed in conspiracy theories or whose religious beliefs contradicted modern history or science; for instance, medical students whose beliefs did not allow contraception or blood transfusions. Many Florida professors and university administrators spoke out in protest, including Thomas Auxter (the President of the United Faculty in Florida) and Roy Weatherfield (the Florida Education Association's higher education director). Auxter characterized H-837 as \"a right-wing political takeover\" of higher education, and later testified about the unclear guidelines the bill would set, saying, \"The standard will be the most easily offended student and whether or not that person will react against what you are saying\". While there was a general consensus that it was inappropriate for professors to push their own views on students or punish them for ideological disagreements, many academic faculty (including Columbia University president Lee Bollinger, in a speech making mention of the bill) stated that discipline for those offenses should be the burden of schools, not courts or legislators.\n\nParagraph 9: Author James Riordan translated a tale from the Tatar people with the title Shaitan the Devil and His Forty Daughters, a man named Safa looks for adventure and rescues a swan in a lake from a black witch. In gratitude, the bird takes Safa to visit her sisters. He is given a little box and a warning not to open it until he reaches home. However, on his way, curiosity takes the better of him and he opens the box: a retinue of market sellers, wares, jades and money comes out of the box. At first, Safa is astonished by the wondrous contents of the box, but, after trying to shut them all back, regrets his decision. Suddenly, a mysterious gray-bearded man offers to help the man, in exchange for what Safa does not know he has at home. Safa closes the box and returns home, only to find his wife gave birth to a son, and immediately regrets his deal. Years later, Safa's son, a jigit, decides to fulfill his father's deal, and stops by a lakeside, waiting for the coming of Shaitan the Devil. He sees a flock of 40 swans coming to the lake and bathing in the water. The jigit creeps behind one of the birds and snatches it, while the other swans fly away. The bird in the jigit's hands shakes off her feathers and becomes a human maiden. She reveals that she is one of Shaitan's daughter, and her father plans to eat him, but he can delay this fate by asking to do chores for him. She flies back to the skies and Shaitan appears soon after to take the boy to his lair in the depths of the forest. the jigit offers to do chores for him, and Shaitan sets three tasks: first, to chop down the forest and sell the wood, then buy rye, plant it and harvest it, grind the corn and store hay - all in one night; secondly, to draw water from a lake to another with a sieve; thirdly, to bridle a wild stallion from Shaitan's stables (which is Shaitan metamorphosed). The jigit fulfills the tasks with the help of the swan girl. Shaitan agrees to marry the jigit to one of his daughters, after the youth passes more tests: to identify his daughter among 40 doves; then, to identify who is his daughter among her sisters, each playing a kurai. After succeeding twice more, Shaitan locks his youngest daughter and the jigit in the dungeons, but the swan girl takes the jigit with her and both escape in a \"Magic Flight\" sequence.\n\nParagraph 10: When Neighbours first began, Number 22 was initially empty. In 1986, the house is rented out by Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), who rented it from an unseen landlord. During his time there, Clive invites Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith), Zoe Davis (Ally Fowler) and Mike Young (Guy Pearce) to move in with him. Clive later begins a relationship with Susan Cole (Gloria Ajenstat) and he invites her to move in. Susan leaves Ramsay Street and Clive moves into a flat behind his surgery. Following Clive's departure, the house is bought by Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) for the Daniels Corporation, who want the land to build a supermarket on. The deal falls through and Paul moves in. When he marries Gail Lewis (Fiona Corke), the couple live there as man and wife until their divorce in 1989. Paul then rents the house to twins Caroline (Gillian Blakeney) and Christina Alessi (Gayle Blakeney). Paul later marries Christina and they live in the house with their son, Andrew (Shannon Holmes). In 1992, Caroline, Christina, Paul and Andrew leave. The house is then rented out to Benito (George Spartels) and Cathy Alessi (Elspeth Ballantyne), who move in with their sons, Marco (Felice Arena) and Rick (Dan Falzon). Marco left in late 1992. Benito and Cathy leave in 1993, causing Rick to move out."}

Newcomb, designed a lifeboat that was completely enclosed and sealed with the occupants receiving air through compressed oxygen tanks. In February 1916, the Newcomb Lifeboat Company was incorporated in Richmond, Virginia. Several days prior to the official declaration of war against Germany in March 1917, the US Congress voted $115,000,000 for the war effort including the purchase of additional torpedo boat destroyers.  Federal agents canvassed all the available shipyards reaching a handshake agreement with Newcomb to build five of its newly designed SC-1-class submarine chasers, one of 33 private yards and 6 navy yards that built the ship. As the Newcomb yard in Richmond was of insufficient size, the company purchased the abandoned facilities of the Chesapeake Gas Engine Corporation in Hampton, Virginia which had a railway large enough to handle several boats. They endeavored to build four ways of which only three were completed.  The company further secured a contract to build a marine railway and install propulsion machinery in twenty wooden hulls. The railway was cancelled after determining that soil conditions would have required extensive and costly dredging. In June 2017, Newcomb secured a contract with the United States Shipping Boards Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFT) to build four Design 1001 cargo ships at a cost of $367,563 per ship. Employment at the yard increased from 212 in July 2017 to 707 in July 2018. In April 1918, the official name of the company was changed to The Hampton Shipbuilding & Marine Railway Corp and the city of incorporation of the company was changed to Hampton, Virginia. In 1918, the five SC-1-class submarine chasers (numbered SC-218 through SC-222) were completed and delivered to the US Navy.  In August 1918, the shipyard was taken over by the Charles H. Tenney & Company which agreed to complete the ships under construction. Three Design 1001 hulls were laid down before the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed and the EFC determined that the massive buildup in shipping was no longer required. In December 2018, the EFC cancelled the contract although agreeing to fund the completion of two ships (then 61% and 82% completed) on a cost plus fee basis. The third hull (21% completed) was discarded.  The Luray was launched on April 17, 1919 and the Kohoka (Kahoka) was launched on July 1, 1919.

The Cardinals had posted the best record in the major leagues that season, and had previously defeated the Red Sox in the  and  Series, with both series going seven games. The third time would be the charm, however, as the momentum and confidence Boston had built up in the ALCS would overwhelm St. Louis. The Red Sox began the Series with an 11–9 win, marked by Mark Bellhorn's game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole. He later on said that he \"just did what he needed to do.\" It was the highest scoring World Series opening game ever (breaking the previous record set in ). The Red Sox would go on to win Game 2 in Boston (thanks to another sensational performance by the bloody-socked Schilling). The Red Sox won both these games despite making 4 errors in each game. In Game 3, Pedro Martínez shut out the Cardinals for seven innings. The Cardinals only made one real threat — in the third inning when they put runners on second and third with no outs. However, the Cardinals' rally was killed by pitcher Jeff Suppan's baserunning gaffe. With no outs, Suppan should have scored easily from third on a Larry Walker ground ball to second baseman Bellhorn, who was playing back, conceding the run. But as Bellhorn threw out Walker at first base, Suppan inexplicably froze after taking several steps toward home and was thrown out by Sox first baseman David Ortiz as he scrambled back to third. The double play was devastating for St. Louis. The Red Sox needed one more game to win their first championship since the 1918 World Series. In Game Four the Red Sox did not allow a run, and the game ended as Édgar Rentería (who would become the 2005 Red Sox starting SS) hit the ball back to Keith Foulke. (This was the second time that Rentería had ended a Series, as he had won it for the Marlins seven years prior in the 1997 World Series.) After Foulke lobbed the ball to Doug Mientkiewicz, the Sox had won their first World Championship in 86 years. The Sox held the Cardinals' offense (the best in the NL in 2004) to only three runs in the last three games, never trailing in the Series. Manny Ramírez was named World Series MVP. The Red Sox won Game Four of the series on October 27, eighteen years to the day from when they lost to the New York Mets in the 1986 World Series. In fact, it came 18 years to the day they lost their last World Series game, as they would sweep the 2004 series.\n\nParagraph 3: During the first work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image that came to him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the character of Spike in mind for a long time beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe \"tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool.\" Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, \"I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does.\" Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a \"typical old-style Japanese man\", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look \"uncool\": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as \"extra cool\". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it \"wouldn't have sounded right\" for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.\n\nParagraph 4: As a requirement of Western League football, Dawlish Town installed floodlights on their ground in 1987. The ground was officially opened February 9, 1987, celebrated when Queens Park Rangers brought their full squad to play the 1st team. At the beginning of the 1987–88 season, Dawlish played host to Aberdeen, and in season 1988–89, both Chelsea and Watford visited Dawlish. Chelsea, in fact, played twice at Dawlish, playing Torquay United in a pre-season friendly as Torquay United's ground was not ready to host pre-season friendlies. Dawlish has also played Crewe Alexandra on several occasions, having established a close relationship with their manager Dario Gradi. It was Dario Gradi who spotted the talents of a Dawlish Youth player Seth Johnson, and for those who do not know – Seth Johnson not only played for Crewe Alexandra, but went on to play for Derby County and Leeds United as well as becoming a full England international. As part of the Western League development standards, Dawlish built new changing rooms in readiness for the 1989–90 season. Since this time, Dawlish has hosted many football league teams, including Burnley, Lincoln, Leyton Orient, Bury, Bristol City, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday, and Wimbledon, as well as our local senior teams Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United, and Exeter City. Not every club in the country can say that one of their teams has played at Wembley Stadium even once, let alone twice! But in May 1996, Dawlish Town won the inaugural Carlsberg Pub Cup Final, with Wembley Stadium hosting the final. Dawlish Town won the cup 4 – 2 on penalties, with the undoubted hero being Dawlish Town's goalkeeper Jamie Day who saved two penalties. Dawlish had also won their semi-final at Anfield by two goals to nil. The second visit to Wembley was on 22 September 1996 when Dawlish played the Dutch Carlsberg Champions Brigade Bodega in a first ever Carlsberg European Pub Cup Championship. On this occasion, Dawlish lost 1 – 0 after conceding a late goal.\n\nParagraph 5: A study of 11 porocarcinomas detected a YAP-NUTM1 fusion gene in the tumor cells in 6 cases while a sampling of 104 promos found this fusion gene in 21 cases; the YAP-NUTM1 fusion gene was not detected in a wide range of other skin tumor types. Other studies have found indirect evidence that this fusion gene was expressed in the PCA tissue cells of 5 of 12 and 8 of 40 PCA cases. A fusion gene is an abnormal gene consisting of parts from two different genes that are merged as a result of a large scale gene mutation such as a chromosomal translocation, interstitial deletion, or inversion. The YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene is a translocation that merges part of the protein coding region of the NUTM1 gene located in band 14 on the long (or \"q\") arm of chromosome 15 with a part of the YAP1 gene located in band 22.1 on the long (i.e. \"q\") arm of chromosome 11 Studies on cultured immortalized human dermal keratinocyte (i.e. HDK) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells found that YAP1-NUTM1 fusion genes stimulated the anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3 cells and activated a transcriptional enhancer factor family member (i.e. TEAD family member) reporter gene. TEAD family transcription factors (also known as transcriptional enhancer factors (TEFs) in humans include four members, TEAD1, TEAD2, TEAD3, and TEAD4 that are transcription factors, i.e. proteins that regulate the expression of various genes. TEAD transcription factors interact with transcription coregulators, including in particular the YAK1 protein, to activate various cell signaling pathways including the Hippo pathway and to regulate cellular maturation, cellular proliferation, and the development of various tissues, organs, and cancers. Cancers associated with the overexpression or overactivation of the TEAD transcription factors include those of the breasts, kidneys, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, prostate, brain (i.e. medulloblastomas), and the head and neck area (i.e. squamous cell carcinomas). It is suggested that the YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene and the Hippo pathway which it activates may contribute to the development and progression of PCA and serve as therapeutic targets to treat YAP1-NUTM1 fusion gene bearing-PCA tumors. However, further studies are needed to confirm these suggestions. The tumor tissues of CPA have also been reported to express the YAP1-MAML2 fusion gene (1 of 11 cases), the EMC7-NUTM1 (EMC7 is the ER membrane protein complex subunit 7 gene, see endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex) fusion gene in a single case, and, in individual cases, mutations in the TP53, RB1, CDKN2A and HRAS    tumor suppressor genes. Further studies are needed to determine if the latter fusion or mutated genes can be used as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for treating PCA tumors.\n\nParagraph 6: During his first AFL pre-season, Stack trained mostly with Richmond's backline unit after coaches recognised his poor aerobic fitness base that caused him to regularly vomit during running sessions would mean he could not play his natural position as an inside midfielder at AFL level. Over the pre-season he found a focus in improving his aerobic fitness, which club officials highlighted as a key deficiency. He played his first football for the club as a half-back in VFL practice matches in March before being named for a round 3 AFL debut against  at Giants Stadium in Sydney. Stack was among Richmond's best players in his debut match, kicking a goal, recording 17 disposals and taking eight marks. He held his spot at AFL level the following week before recording 22 disposals against  in round 5 where he was named among Richmond's best players by The Age. Stack gained significant fan and media attention in round 6's ANZAC Day eve win over  where he took a spectacular mark that was nominated for the AFL's Mark of the Week and laid a brutal-but-legal bump on Melbourne captain Jack Viney that resulted in a two-week shoulder injury to the receiving Viney. After nine rounds of the season and seven matches AFL matches, Stack ranked fourth in total marks and total intercepts, fifth in effective disposals per game and eight in total rebound 50s among Rising Star eligible players. In round 10's Dreamtime at the 'G Indigenous culture celebration match, Stack participated in the club's pre-game war cry usually performed by non-playing club representatives. The following week he posted a then career-best 24 disposals, five marks and four tackles in a loss to , earning a nomination for the league's Rising Star award. To that point, he ranked number one among Rising Star eligible players for total intercepts, second in total marks and seventh in both total disposals and tackles that season. Stack was named in the AFL Media Team of the Week for round 13 following as loss to  in which he recorded 22 disposals. 1116 SEN commentator Kane Cornes labelled Stack one of the biggest 'steals' in draft history following that match and ranked him as the second most promising player from his draft class. At the same time, Stack was ranked number one that season among Rising Star eligible players under Champion Data's AFL player ratings system. Following the club's mid-season bye and after the injury return of many of Richmond's senior leaders, Stack was shifted from the backline into a forward role for the club's round 15 match up against . He was exceptional in his first time playing that role, kicking four goals in a performance that saw him named among Richmond's best players by the Herald Sun, The Age and AFL Media. In addition, he was named best on ground by the coaches with nine votes in the AFLCA player of the year award and was also named to AFL Media's team of the week. Stack remained as a forward through the month of July, kicking three goals over his next four matches but suffering calf soreness in the lead-up to round 20's match against  that forced him to sit out that win. He returned for one match at AFL level but was omitted from the senior side in round 22 following a 12 disposal performance. Stack excelled with 15 disposals in the first half of his first match at VFL level since March, before suffering a serious ankle injury just before half time. He underwent surgery to repair what was revealed to be a syndesmosis injury and with a recovery time frame of four weeks, was at risk of missing the entirety of the club's AFL and VFL finals series. Stack resumed weight-assisted running one week after his surgery and was running unassisted and taking part in light drills by the middle of September. He returned to football in the club's VFL grand final, five weeks after his initial injury. Stack played on reduced minutes and suffered a fresh minor rolled ankle in the match, notching a total of six disposals as his side won the club's first reserves premiership since 1997. He was considered sufficiently fit to be named an emergency for the following week's AFL grand final, though he would go unselected in the final premiership-winning side. At season's end, Stack placed third in the league's Rising Star award and was named in the AFL players' association's 22under22 team, which recognises the best young players in the league. He also placed equal 13th in the club's best and fairest count and won the Cosgrove-Jenkins award as Richmond's best first year player.\n\nParagraph 7:  Assy McGee (Larry Murphy) – a walking, talking lower torso with exposed buttocks. Horribly violent, an alcoholic and clinically depressed, Assy is a parody of the 1970s/1980s movie cops as seen in such films as Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon and Cobra: trigger-happy, tough, at times hopelessly depressed, and in conflict with his fellow officers as often as he is in conflict with crime.  Assy has a slurred style of speech similar to Sylvester Stallone, though it is \"gassy\" sounding and muffled, possibly due to his anatomy or inebriation (or both), however has been shown to have an excellent ability to sing classical music.  He also quotes and mimics some of Stallone's most memorable characters, shouting Judge Dredd's catch phrase \"I am the law!\" in episode five \"Mexican Rain\" and reenacts the Rocky training scene in episode seven \"Ring of Fire\".  Sometimes, when out of breath, or even just peeved, Assy will flatulate. Assy walks backwards and even jumps backwards. Assy has stated that he is of Cuban descent. His Cuban heritage is backed up in the episode, \"Conviction\" when a childhood picture of Assy with a Cuban hat is shown in the background. We learn in the episode \"Hands Up\" (from season two) that Assy served in Vietnam, when a war flashback causes him to accidentally fire a bullet from an AK-47 into the abdomen of a World War II veteran. It is unclear whether Assy possesses genitalia, though it is strongly implied on a few occasions. He has been shown walking in profile with no visible genital protrusion or covering, but he requested a \"happy ending\" from a masseuse in the episodes \"The Flirty Black Man\", and \"Murder By The Docks\". He is also perfectly capable of urinating in the canonical fashion. Licensed action figures and other merchandise of the character cover his genital area with part of his handgun holster. In the episode Vowel Play, it is implied that Assy has undersized genitals when he indicates that he can only give a school sex education teacher \"four and half inches\". It is also unclear how he can pick up or handle anything as he has no hands. Items he is 'holding' simply float in front of him.  One commonly \"floating\" item seen around Assy is his revolver, which appears to mimic a Colt Python or Colt King Cobra. In addition to his police duties, Assy owns a used car, hot tub, and driveway repair dealership off \"Exit 19\" in Exeter which he does a commercial for wearing a cowboy hat and boots. He claims to have all the new  in stock, as well as having a true price guarantee and an unwillingness to give cars to people without credit (\"Bad credit? No credit? Sorry, that's your problem, asshole!\") His slogan for the business is \"Don't make me run your ass over!\" Appearing only in season two, the \"commercial\" aired midway through each episode during the season and was part of a promotional arrangement between Adult Swim and Toyota, the parent company of Scion.\n\nParagraph 8: The neighborhood's cat owners all (literally) throw their cats out for the night. Porky Pig attempts to do the same, but his four cats (a tall black and white lisping cat (Sylvester), a medium-sized tabby, a diminutive kitten, and a dumb drunkard cat) attempt to turn the tables and throw him out into the snow. Porky states that he is starting to hate pussycats. Porky bangs on the door, demanding to be let in, but the cats pop out of the door and proclaim in unison, \"Milkman, keep those bottles quiet!\", and then slam the door in his face which soon leads to a battle between Porky and his cats for the house.\n\nParagraph 9: The family later goes to the hospital to visit the farmer who was injured in the giant accident, only to find that Mr. Charming (revealed to be Prince Charming) has beaten them and erased the farmer's memory. Despite this, they interview the farmer's wife at his bedside. The farmer's wife, Mrs. Applebee, informs them that her husband had sworn he'd seen a giant, but she believes a different theory. She says there was a British man who often visited their farm and asked to rent their field, but became hostile when they refused. She says that later, the man had returned, apologized for being so rude, and offered to pay for them to stay in New York City as an apology. Mrs. Applebee had gone with her sister rather than her husband. When they arrived, the hotel had no record of their reservation. On the way out, the family is ambushed by a group of 'goons' who threaten the Grimms to abandon the case. Granny is not scared, and instead sees this as a sign they are on the right path. Granny decides to follow the gang and find out who employed them in a stakeout. On the way, she tells them about giants. the only person to ever have successfully robbed and killed a giant was Jack,(from Jack and the Beanstalk), but now he works at a retail store in town. On the stakeout, while granny and canis are distracted, sabrina makes an attempt to escape with Daphne, despite Daphne's protests. just after they leave the car, it is attacked by a giant. The giant, chanting about how he must find \"the englishman\" picks up the car, containing granny and canis, and walks away with it, leaving the girls alone in the woods with only granny's handbag. They try to hitchhike, but encounter Officer Hamstead, one of the three little pigs. He offers to drive the girls home, but they discover he works for Mr. Charming, and make an escape. The girls follow pixie lights into the woods and soon meet Puck (from A Midsummer Night's Dream). Puck originally believes they are spies and tries to drown them, claiming they have stolen the old lady away from him. they mistake  him for the infamous Peter Pan, which enrages him even further. He originally decides that he won't help them find granny because he is a self-proclaimed villain. Ultimately he follows them home, helps them get back into the house, and agrees to help them save their grandmother just because she was kind to him and fed him since he was little. Puck and Sabrina share a clear hatred for each other and spend the majority of the time bickering. Sabrina and Daphne find their father's diary, detailing his accounts with Mayor Charming. It reveals that the upcoming fundraiser ball at prince charming's mansion is a scam he created to make money after a series of business fails. They also find out that giants are very gullible. They theorize that Mayor Charming tricked a giant into crushing the house for him, and that Mayor Charming is the 'Englishman'.\n\nParagraph 10: In August 2004, he was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving following a fatal crash on 23 November 2003. Following his release from prison in 2007, he returned to the professional game with Oldham Athletic of League One. He signed for Notts County in July 2009, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year after scoring 30 league goals as the club won the League Two title in 2009–10. He left Notts County to sign for Port Vale in January 2013 and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012–13. In January 2014, he signed for Forest Green Rovers on an 18-month deal. In January 2015, he returned to Kidderminster Harriers, and moved on to Ilkeston and then Worcester City in the summer. He continued to be a prolific goalscorer into his 40s and signed with AFC Telford United in February 2017. He began his management career as joint-manager of Worcester City, alongside John Snape, in May 2017. In March 2018, he joined Halesowen Town as a player, where he remained until moving on to Mickleover Sports in August 2019. He later played for Grantham Town, Nuneaton Borough, Cradley Town and Stourport Swifts."}

Arab propaganda claims that Jews want to take over the Temple Mount and destroy Muslim structures, while Muslim leaders, led by Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the mufti of Jerusalem, have been campaigning since 1928 to assert Muslim rights over the Western Wall. Construction ordered by al-Husseini caused disturbances for those wishing to pray at the Wall. Jewish leaders appealed to the British authorities for intervention, but no action was taken. On August 14, 1929, Jewish nationalists marched to the Western Wall, raising their flag and shouting slogans. Rumors were spread that Jewish youths had attacked Arabs and insulted Muhammad, and fliers were distributed urging Muslims to seek vengeance. The next day, hundreds of Muslims converged on the Western Wall, burning prayer books and injuring the beadle. The violence spread to the Jewish commercial area and a young Jew was stabbed to death. On August 22, armed Arab villagers gathered at the Haram al-Sharif, and an inflammatory preacher incited violence against Jews. Inflamed by rumors, the Arabs began to attack Jews in the Old City and burn shops.

VWS mutations appear to result in haploinsufficiency while PPS mutations may be dominant negative in nature. The spectrum of mutations in VWS and PPS has been recently summarized. IRF6 has been shown to play a critical role in keratinocyte development. A role for IRF6 in the common forms of cleft lip and palate has also been demonstrated and may explain ~20% of cases of cleft lip only. Variants in IRF6 have yielded consistent evidence of association with syndromic cleft and/or palate across multiple studies. A study by Birnbaum and colleagues in 2009 confirmed the impact of this gene on the etiology of cleft lip and/or palate, and the GENEVA Cleft Consortium study, which studied families from multiple populations, reconfirmed the findings that IRF6 mutations are strongly associated with cleft and/or palate.  A role of IRF6 in causing cleft lip and/or palate is further supported by analysis of IRF6 mutant mice which exhibit a hyper-proliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal differentiation, leading to multiple epithelial adhesions that can occlude the oral cavity and result in cleft palate. Research on animal models indicate IRF6 determines keratinocyte proliferation and also has a key role in the formation of oral periderm. Recently, through utilization of mouse genetics, gene expression analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and luciferase reporter assays, it has been shown that IRF6 is a direct target of p63, which underlies several malformation syndromes that include cleft features, and p63 activates IRF6 transcription through the IRF6 enhancer element.  Variation in the enhancer element increases susceptibility to cleft lip only. Both cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and cleft palate only features have been seen in families with an IRF6 mutation. In addition, different types of clefts can segregate within the same family.\n\nParagraph 2: Armed assault version of the Mi-8AMT, can carry the same range of weapons as the Mi-24 including unguided weapons and high-precision armaments, in particular, antitank guided 9M120 Ataka or 9M114 Shturm missiles. Fitted with a new large door on the right side (except the prototype), aramid fiber plates around the cockpit area and engines, and sometimes a loading ramp in place of the usual clamshell doors. The helicopter can carry up to 37 paratroopers, 12 wounded on stretchers or airlift up to 4 tons of cargo, engage in search-and-rescue and evacuation operations. The craft has two VK-2500 engines of enhanced capacity and a complex of defense means. The cockpit of the new helicopter is equipped with multifunctional indicators to display the map of the terrain and the latest navigational and piloting equipment which operates with GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation systems. The Russian air force received a first batch of 10 Mi-8AMTSh in December 2010, and a second batch in June 2011. Deliveries were continued in 2012 and 2013. Russian Defense Ministry signed a contract for 40 helicopters in August 2013. First 8 upgraded helicopters were delivered in 2014. In total, 40 helicopters were delivered in 2014. Long-term government contract to supply modernized Mi-8AMTSh was signed in Ulan-Ude in August 2013 and provides for the delivery of unique machines – the first production batch with improved resource performance including significant savings on maintenance during the life cycle of the helicopter. Mi-8AMTSh passed to the Defense Ministry obtains a larger capacity engines VK-2500 with an upgraded (reinforced) transmission that provide objective control of exploratory work, and make the use of the helicopter in the highlands and hot climates more efficient. 13 helicopters were delivered in 2015. 8 helicopters were delivered in the first half of 2016. More than 20 Mi-8AMTs and Mi-8AMTShs were delivered to the Russian Interior Ministry in recent years. Mi-8AMTSh-VA arctic version is also supplied to the Russian Air Force and Naval Aviation. The first batch of Mi-8AMTSh for 2017 was delivered in late May. A new delivery in June 2017. 13 more in early 2018. A new large delivery in June 2018. The last delivery held in December 2018. A new delivery of a special modification held in early 2019. New deliveries in November 2019 and April 2020. 10 Mi-8AMTSH-VN Special Ops helicopters are on order since summer 2019 and the first helicopters reportedly entered service as of late 2021. 2 helicopters were delivered and 6 modernized with the Vitebsk onboard defense system in July 2020.\n\nParagraph 3: 1837, June: Fese's Ashitla-Tilitl campaign: Akhmet Khan of Mekhtuli (?modern Dzhengutai, 33 km E), the temporary ruler of the Avar Khanate, fearing Shamil, arranged for the Russians to occupy Khunzakh. On 29 May 5000 Russians reached Khunzakh from Temir-Khan-Shura, having taken 20 days and building a road as they went. On 5 June Fese left Khunzakh for Shamil's headquarters at Ashitla (9 km W on the Andi Koysu).  Untsukul submitted and on 8 June he was on the Betl plateau overlooking Ashitla.  Here he detached a battalion to deal with Tilitl (see below).   The next day they crossed the Betl River and came to Ashitla which was occupied by 2000 Murids. The village was taken by 2PM with a good deal of house-to-house fighting, but the Russian losses were only 28 killed and 156 wounded. They counted 87 enemy dead, but many were probably carried away. No prisoners were taken. Some Murids retreated north of the river and some east to Old Akhulgo where many were killed and 78 taken prisoner. The vineyards and orchards around Ashitla were devastated. A fresh horde of mountaineers, said to be 12,000, appeared near Igali and Fese, around the 15th, performed a \"strategic movement to the rear\", losing 7 officers and 160 men.   Meanwhile, Shamil was besieged in Tilitl (probably , 37 km S). On 7 June he had made a sortie, both sides losing about 300 men, which was a significant share of their forces.  Fese reached Tilitl on 26 June. Tilitl had 600 houses, nine towers, steep slopes on three sides and a cliff behind. The towers were soon blasted by artillery and a general assault was made on 5 July. Half the village was gained with much slaughter and Shamil sent envoys to treat for peace. An agreement was made that neither side would attack the other, which amounted to a Russian recognition of Shamil's sovereignty. Fese withdrew on the 7th and reached Khunzakh on the 10th. Fese's withdrawal at a point of near victory is explained by the condition of his army.  He had lost 1000 men, most of his horses and wagons, his soldiers needed boots and he was short of ammunition. Fese claimed he had won and Shamil presented his retreat as divine intervention.  Shamil went north, surveyed the ruins of Ashitla and set about building a stronger fort at Akhulgo (9 km NW on the Andi Koysu).\n\nParagraph 4: Another key source of tension concerned the status of the Western Wall and al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. On the one hand, the claim that Jews wanted to retake what Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call Haram al-Sharif and destroy the Muslim structures there had been a persistent theme of Arab propaganda. On the other hand, led by Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the mufti of Jerusalem, a campaign had begun in 1928 to reassert Muslim rights over the Western Wall, which was owned by Muslim authorities; al-Husseini ordered new construction in front of and on top of the Wall, and bricks from the construction fell on those who wished to pray there, while excrement from mules befouled the area in front of the Wall. Both sides viewed these developments as symbolically powerful to their respective causes. Jewish leaders appealed to the British authorities to intervene; when they did not, while British authorities were on leave, On August 14, 1929, hundreds of Jewish nationalists marched to the Western Wall shouting slogans such as \"The Wall is Ours\" and raising the Jewish national flag. Rumours, apparently part of an organized campaign, spread that Jewish youths had also attacked Arabs and had cursed Muhammad; Husseini's activists handed out fliers that appeared to have been pre-published appealing, with inflammatory religious rhetoric, to Muslims to avenge \"the honor of Islam.\" Following an inflammatory sermon the next day, hundreds of Muslims organized by the Supreme Muslim Council converged on the Western Wall, burning prayer books and injuring the beadle. The rioting soon spread to the Jewish commercial area of town and the next day, August 17, a young Jew was stabbed to death. The authorities failed to quell the violence. On the evening of Thursday, August 22 and early the next morning, Arab villagers armed with sticks and knives gathered at the Haram al-Sharif. During the morning prayers, a nationalist preacher exhorted the Muslim faithful to fight against the Jews until the last drop of blood; gunshots were heard coming from the compound to excite the crowd. Inflamed by rumors that Jews were planning to attack al-Aqsa Mosque, Arabs left the compound and were spoken to by Husseini, who was instructed by the British authorities to calm the crowd, but in their impression excited them further; they then began to attack Jews in the Old City of Jerusalem and burn shops. Segev notes that whether the first victims were Jews or Arabs is a matter of much dispute; Laurens claims that the first murders of the day took place when two or three Arabs passing by the Jewish Quarter of Mea Shearim were killed. Rumours that Jews had massacred Arabs in Jerusalem then reached Hebron by that evening; the first murder, of a Jewish student alone in a yeshiva, occurred that evening.\n\nParagraph 5: Early on September 8, a cluster of thunderstorms came together as a low-pressure area with improving outflow and a developing low-level circulation center (LLCC). Later that day, the JMA upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression north-northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands. Over the next two days, the system gradually drifted west and intensified slightly, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on it. Convection gradually consolidated the LLCC and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system on September 11, designating it with 18W. The next day, the depression drifted into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and the PAGASA initiated advisories on the depression, naming it Onyok. However, just as similar to Kulap, Onyok also exited the PAR in 6 hours from entering the region. In an advisory, the JTWC reported that there were at least two more vortices associated with the system, that caused an abrupt, erratic movement. However, being located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression continued to strengthen and on September 13, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Roke. On September 17, Roke developed a small, deep convective eye promoting the JMA to upgrade Roke to a severe tropical storm with winds of over . Between September 19 and 20, Roke underwent Explosive intensification, a more extreme case of rapid deepening that involves a tropical cyclone deepening at a rate of at least 2.5 mbar per hour for a minimum of 12 hours. Also, they added that Roke developed a  eye and a good poleward outflow channel. On September 21, Typhoon Roke made landfall over Hamamatsu, Japan at about 5:00 UTC (14:00 JST). Soon Roke started weakening as cloud tops started getting warmed up and eye diameter started to decrease. However, the system still maintained a near radial outflow and the convective structure continued to remain organized that kept Roke from dissipating rapidly. Although Roke entered a de-intensification phase, it still had plenty of strength that posed a great threat to regions of Japan. Being located approximately  southwest of Yokosuka, the typhoon accelerated north-northwestward at approximately  with winds of over  (1-min sustained) being a Category 3 typhoon on the SSHS. Being embedded in the baroclinic zone, Roke started its extratropical transition. Also, land interaction severely weakened the storm to a minimal Category 1 typhoon with winds of under  (1-min sustained). Only six hours later, the storm further weakened and accelerated northeastward at approximately  with rapidly dissipating deep convection completely sheared to the northeast of the LLCC. As a result, the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm, as it became fully extratropical.\n\nParagraph 6: The course is  in length, meaning full runners ran two laps and half runners ran one lap before entering the 1.54 mile oval.  The course started in the parking lot behind the Jimmie Johnson Grandstand (had been known as the Winners before June 2020; named for the 2019 Boston Marathon celebrity finisher) on Mount Pleasant Road.  Runners take the start in the parking lot on Mount Pleasant Road, crossing Perimeter Road, before starting the lap by turning right on Speedway Boulevard before a right turn on Wilkins Road, going south before crossing the turnaround past Perimeter Road and run north up Wilkins Road, running north, leaving Speedway premises before another turnaround just past Mount Pleasant Road where runners again run on the opposite direction, turning right on Speedway Boulevard and passing through Atlanta Speedway Airport.  Runners follow Speedway before turning left at Lower Woolsey Road, where runners proceed to the entrance ramp from Georgia 20, where another turnaround occurs.  From Lower Woolsey, runners jut right into the Weaver parking lot where the course splits on the second and third laps.  On the first two laps, runners then turn right on Speedway Boulevard where before turning right at the Turn 3 tunnel access road before a quick left to Richard Petty Boulevard.  From Richard Petty Boulevard, runners turn left to Perimeter Road where the course turns left where runners cross the Tara Place condominiums and run on the road before making a right and a left past the end of the frontstretch grandstands.  Returning to Outer Perimeter Road to concluded the lap, full marathoners turned right on Speedway Boulevard to start the second lap.  At the end of the second lap, runners turn left to Speedway Boulevard and follow it to Lower Woolsey Road and continue route as the previous two laps until they reach the Weaver parking lot.  Instead of turning right on Speedway Boulevard, they turn left to follow a service vehicle road that rings around Turns 1 and 2 of the speedway oval before turning left on the service vehicle road, followed by a turnaround that allows runners to access the Turn 1-2 tunnel that enters the speedway, making a short run through the Flock Brothers Corral infield camping area before entering the speedway at the road course exit for a traditional finish to the marathon reminiscent of athletics, with runners making 1 3/4 laps around the speedway, returning to pit lane where the finish line runs parallel to the start-finish line of the speedway.\n\nParagraph 7: He picked up his maiden five-wicket haul in ODI cricket as well as in international cricket in only in his second ODI appearance when he ran through the powerhouse England batting order by taking the wickets of Nick Knight, Michael Vaughan, Craig White, Ronnie Irani and Andy Caddick. He also became the first Namibian ever to have taken a fifer in ODI cricket as well as first Namibian player to grab a five-wicket haul in any form of international cricket and also remains the first and only player from Namibia to have taken a five wicket haul in a World Cup match. He also became the first bowler ever to pick up a five-wicket haul in an ODI at the St George's Park, Port Elizabeth. He was also one of the eleven bowlers to have taken a five-wicket haul during the 2003 edition of the Cricket World Cup. His spell of 5/43 in ten overs including two maiden overs restricted England to 272 all out and his bowling efforts gave Namibia a glimmer of hope in their contest against England, but Namibia fell short of chasing the target of 273 by a margin of 55 runs despite a much improved batting performance by Namibia, albeit of a well composed half-century from the opener Jan-Berry Burger. His bowling figures of 5/43 remained as the best bowling figures by a bowler for Namibia in ODI cricket for 16 years until it was surpassed by Jan Frylinck on 27 April 2019. However, his record breaking spell of 5/43 remains the best bowling figures by a Namibian bowler against a top-tier test playing nation. He is also the first associate cricketer to have taken a fifer against a test playing nation in a World Cup match and he became only the third associate player to claim a fifer in a World Cup match after Shaukat Dukanwala of UAE and Austin Codrington of Canada. His spell of 5/43 against England is regarded as one of the best ever performances by an associate player in the history of the Cricket World Cup.\n\nParagraph 8: The discography of American country pop singer Marie Osmond contains 12 studio albums, three compilation albums, one soundtrack album, one video album, six music videos, 33 singles and 2 album appearances. She first gained exposure on television with her siblings' group, The Osmonds. She then signed her own recording contract with MGM Records. Osmond specifically chose to be marketed towards the country field. In 1973, she released her debut single, \"Paper Roses.\" The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and crossed into the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. Her debut studio album of the same name also topped Billboard'''s country albums chart and spent 20 weeks on the survey. It was also her highest charting album on the Billboard 200 all-genre chart, climbing to number 59. She followed this with 1974's \"In My Little Corner of the World\" and 1975's \"Who's Sorry Now.\" Both singles reached the top 40 of the Billboard country songs chart. In addition, she released two more studio albums with MGM during this period. She then began a duet career with her brother during the latter half of the 1970s. However, in 1977 she recorded a solo album of pop music entitled This Is the Way That I Feel.Osmond returned to country on Curb Records in the 1980s. Her 1985 duet with Dan Seals called \"Meet Me in Montana\" reached number one on the Billboard country songs chart. Her next release was the solo single \"There's No Stopping Your Heart,\" which also topped the country chart. Her 1985 album of the same name peaked at number 16 on the country albums chart. Her 1986 studio effort, I Only Wanted You reached a similar top 20 country chart position and spent 37 weeks on the list. Its lead single, \"You're Still New to Me\" (a duet with Paul Davis), reached number one on the country songs chart in 1986. Her subsequent singles for Curb did not become major hits, yet she continued releasing new material. Her final Curb release was 1989's Steppin' Stone, which reached number 68 on the Top Country Albums survey. After a several-year hiatus, her 1995 single \"What Kind of Man (Walks on a Woman)\" reached number 75 on the country songs chart. It is Osmond's last charting single to date. After 20 years, she returned to her music career with 2007's Magic of Christmas. She followed it with I Can Do This in 2010. In 2016, she released her most recent studio effort entitled Music Is Medicine. It peaked at number 10 that year. In 2021, Osmond released her twelfth studio record titled Unexpected'', which centers on orchestral and standards songs.\n\nParagraph 9: Bonavia was born in Valletta in British colonial Malta, the third son of Mary née Hobson and Calcedonio Bonavia. An older brother Giuseppe became an architect in the Royal Engineers while another brother George became an artist. Emanuel studied medicine at the University of Malta and at the University of Edinburgh qualifying MRCS in 1857. He was commissioned Assistant Surgeon in the Indian Medical Service on 4 August 1857 and was present at the capture of Lucknow in March 1858 and saw action at the trans-Gogra campaign. He was promoted Surgeon Major in 1876 and Brigade Surgeon in 1885, retiring in 1888. He served as Principal of the medical school at Balrampur in 1873. Trained in medical botany, he came to take charge of the Lucknow garden in 1876. The Lucknow botanical garden began as a park after 1857. He then began to study the cultivation of citrus, date palms (an interest in date palms also led to studies on floral depiction in Assyrian monuments, suggesting that the Assyrian sacred tree was based on multiple trees of value including a date palm as the trunk) and other plants of economic importance. He wrote a book examining the prospects of cultivating date palms in India and The Villager's Domestic Medicine (1885). He speculated on the ancestry of Indian acid lime. He also published on sericulture in Oudh. He was also interested in other aspects of natural history and wrote a book on evolution which examined such aspects as the evolution of spots and stripes in wild cats and the origins of other animal skin patterning. He speculated that these patterns were derived from armoured ancestors such as glyptodonts with the ancestral rosette as seen in the leopard consolidated into spots in cheetahs, blotches, and stripes in other cats. In his Contributions to Christology (1869) he attempted to identify rational explanations for miracles involving animals. He corresponded with Charles Darwin, and naturalists in India such as Allan Octavian Hume to whom he sent bird specimens. He was one of the founders of the Lucknow museum (Oudh provincial museum), established in 1863. He contributed specimens to the museum, including that of a pink-headed duck, obtained from the local market. Bonavia also maintained careful records of weather and examined long-term variation in the patterns of rains, supporting the theory that linked them to sun-spots. He also served as a Civil Surgeon at Etawah and worked on public sanitation, making attempts to stop open defecation in Lucknow. Bonavia retired in 1888 and lived on Richmond road, Worthing, Sussex, continuing to take an interest in gardening and hybridization of ornamental plants, publishing in the Gardener's Chronicle, until his death.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1982, the Conservative Government led by Margaret Thatcher privatised these services, making shares in the newly formed National Freight Corporation available to employees at a price that proved to undervalue the company when they were floated on the stock market. Two businesses, National Carriers and Roadline, subsequently merged and operated briefly under the name National Carriers Roadline before becoming Lynx Express Delivery Network. This remained the company's full title, although it was shortened in practice. Following a reorganisation, rationalisation of core business interests and rebranding exercise, National Freight Corporation, by this time shortened to NFC plc, merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel, and Lynx Express was seen as outside its main area of concentration."}

Harry's paternity is uncertain when his mother, Toni, becomes pregnant in 2001 after being romantically involved with both Adam and Chris. Through a DNA test, it is revealed that Chris is Harry's biological father. Harry is kidnapped multiple times, first by Donna Heka and later by Toni's ex-boyfriend Logan King. In 2004, Harry and Toni are kidnapped again by Toni's mentally unstable brother Dominic. Harry's behavior becomes problematic, and he bites Huia Samuels' hand in a fit of anger. Years later, Toni dies, and Harry struggles to accept Chris' new girlfriends. He forms a bond with his newfound brother, Phoenix, and clashes with Rachel McKenna, Chris' girlfriend at the time. In 2013, Harry experiences a near-death incident after consuming a potion made of poisonous plants. He survives without brain damage thanks to Chris' intervention. Harry then falls in love with Pixie, who battles bone cancer but eventually succumbs to pneumonia. He later leaves for a study abroad program in Japan and then gets transferred to Shanghai, China. Harry returns after discovering that he has gotten his homestay sister, Zhilan Li, pregnant. Zhilan travels to New Zealand to find Harry, but he decides not to seek help from Chris after witnessing him paying off someone. Finn secretly provides financial support to Harry after Chris cuts him off.", "The text discusses the conflict between the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) and the District 26, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) union in the Sydney coalfield. BESCO took over the DOMCO mines in 1920 and aimed to break the union. After many small strikes, a major strike occurred in 1925 when BESCO refused to negotiate with the union. The strike lasted from March to August, with miners picketing and causing disruptions at BESCO facilities. Tensions escalated on June 11, 1925, when company police clashed with striking miners, resulting in the death of one miner named Davis. This incident led to further clashes and attacks on company properties. The escalating violence led to the deployment of the provincial police force and Canadian Army to control the situation. Eventually, BESCO accepted government intervention and settled the strike. However, the labor activism in Industrial Cape Breton continued. BESCO was later merged into a larger corporation called the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation."], "answers": ["Paragraph 5", "Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 9"], "context": "Paragraph 1: In 1988, the general elections were held again which marked the PPP coming in power but dismissed in two years following the amid lawlessness situation in the country. In 1990, the general elections saw the right-wing alliance forming the government but dismissed in 1993 after the alliance collapse. The general elections in 1993 saw the PPP forming government after successfully seeking plurality in the Parliament. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made critical decisions during her era, ranging from working to strengthening the education, defense, foreign policy and pressed her policies hard to implement her domestic programs initiatives. Despite her tough rhetoric, Prime Minister Bhutto's own position deteriorated in her native province, Sindh, and lost her support following the death of her younger brother. Tales of high-scale corruption cases also maligned her image in the country and was dismissed from her post by her own hand-picked president in 1996. The 1997 general elections saw the centre-right, Pakistan Muslim League (N), or PML (N), gaining the exclusive mandate in the country and supermajority in the parliament. Despite Sharif's popularity in 1998 and popular peace initiatives in 1999, the conspiracy was hatched against Sharif by General Musharraf, accusing Sharif of hijacking the plane and pressed terrorism charges against Sharif in the military courts; thus ending Sharif's government.\n\nParagraph 2: In 2001 Toni Thompson (Laura Hill) fell pregnant but it was not clear who the father was as she had been sleeping with both Adam Heywood (Leighton Cardno) and Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). She gave birth several months prematurely in May 2002 and it was not until Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) had the babies DNA tested that Chris was revealed as the father. In 2003 Harry went missing and it was soon revealed he had been kidnapped by a mentally unstable Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi). The following year he was kidnapped again, this time by Toni's former flame, Logan King (Peter Muller). In 2004 Harry and Toni were kidnapped by Toni's deranged brother Dominic (Shane Cortese) in an attempt to kill Chris. Harry caused trouble for Chris and Toni the following year, when his tantrums climaxed in him biting Huia Samuels (Nicola Kawana) hand. Toni fled Ferndale in 2007 and took Harry with her but upon their return, the family scraped death in a dramatic car crash. Harry was devastated months later when Toni died and struggled to come to terms with Chris' succession of girlfriends – going so far as to force him to break up with Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen). In 2010 Harry struggled to cope with the revelation he had a brother, Phoenix (Geordie Holibar) but grew to love him. He clashed with Chris' girlfriend Rachel McKenna and pressed charges when she lightly slapped him. During Halloween 2013, Harry stopped breathing and lost his heart beat for 45 minutes after drinking a potion made of several garden weeds, including foxglove. However, after Chris used his chief executive officer position at the hospital to register prolonged CPR, Harry survived without brain damage. In early 2015 Harry met Pixie Hannah (Thomasin McKenzie) and after initial clashes, the two began to date. However Pixie was diagnosed with bone cancer and Harry supported her through the following treatment but was devastated when she succumbed to pneumonia shortly after the two had confessed their love. Harry leaves in early 2017 to attend an exchange program in Japan only to then get transferred to Shanghai, China. He then appears in a Skype call with his Dad. Harry would return in October 2017 after it was revealed he had gotten his homestay sister, Zhilan Li pregnant after falling in love with her. Zhilan proceeded to escape to New Zealand to find Harry, but Harry decided not to ask Chris for help after witnessing him paying off Mindy, Frank's ex-wife. He was secretly given allowances by Finn after Chris decided to cut him off financially.\n\nParagraph 3: Pathfinding, another common use for AI, is widely seen in real-time strategy games. Pathfinding is the method for determining how to get a NPC from one point on a map to another, taking into consideration the terrain, obstacles and possibly \"fog of war\". Commercial videogames often use fast and simple \"grid-based pathfinding\", wherein the terrain is mapped onto a rigid grid of uniform squares and a pathfinding algorithm such as A* or IDA* is applied to the grid. Instead of just a rigid grid, some games use irregular polygons and assemble a navigation mesh out of the areas of the map that NPCs can walk to. As a third method, it is sometimes convenient for developers to manually select \"waypoints\" that NPCs should use to navigate; the cost is that such waypoints can create unnatural-looking movement. In addition, waypoints tend to perform worse than navigation meshes in complex environments. Beyond static pathfinding, navigation is a sub-field of Game AI focusing on giving NPCs the capability to navigate in a dynamic environment, finding a path to a target while avoiding collisions with other entities (other NPC, players...) or collaborating with them (group navigation). Navigation in dynamic strategy games with large numbers of units, such as Age of Empires (1997) or Civilization V (2010), often performs poorly; units often get in the way of other units.\n\nParagraph 4: In Mexico, Guerrero joined a gym with the intention to learn to box, but instead learned lucha libre from Diablo Velasco and El Indio Mejía. He wrestled his first professional wrestling match on September 14, 1937, jobbing to El Rojo. He began his career in Mexico working under the ring name Joe Morgan, but later changed his name to Gory Guerrero—a reference to his bloody matches. He made his debut for the Mexico City promotion Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre (EMLL) in 1943 and was named \"Rookie of the Year\" later that year. In 1945, he briefly held the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. Several months later, he won the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, which he held for approximately one year. Guerrero and his brothers also feuded with Cavernario Galindo and his brothers. In the late 1940s, Guerrero began tag teaming with El Santo as the undefeated La Pareja Atómica (The Atomic Pair). Guerrero also appeared in some of El Santo's films. He also feuded with Enrique Llanes and his tag team partner Tarzán López. He defeated Lopez for the NWA Middleweight title. In 1954, he wrestled a championship match against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz but did not win the title.\n\nParagraph 5: A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, in the 1460s, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1464–1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest Chinese man, Wu Rui (吳瑞) was selected by the Vietnamese court for castration since he was the only young man in among the thirteen and he became a eunuch at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long for nearly one fourth of a century. After years of serving the Vietnamese as a eunuch slave in the palace, he was promoted to a position with real power after the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam as military superintendent since his service in the palace was apparently valued by the Vietnamese. However the Lạng Sơn guard soldier Dương Tam tri (Yang Sanzhi) (楊三知) told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou after walking for 9 days through the mountains. The local ethnic minority Tusi chief Wei Chen took him into custody, overruling objections from his family who wanted to send him back to Vietnam. Vietnam found out about his escape and sent an agent to buy Wu Rui back from Wei Chen with 100 Jin in payment since they were scared that Wu Rui would reveal Vietnamese state secrets to China. Wei Chen planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese but told them the amount they were offering was too little and demanded more however before they could agree on a price, Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate Li Guangning and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the Ming palace at the Directorate of Ceremonial (silijian taijian 司禮監太監). The Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư records that in 1467 in An Bang province of Dai Viet (now Quảng Ninh Province) a Chinese ship blew off course onto the shore. The Chinese were detained and not allowed to return to China as ordered by Le Thanh Tong. This incident may be the same one where Wu Rui was captured.\n\nParagraph 6: Jews were especially involved as translators. Moses ibn Tibbon translated from the Arabic Jabir ben Aflah's acute criticisms of the Ptolemaic system, an anticipation of Copernicus, and thus brought them to the notice of Maimonides. Ibn al-Haitham's Arabic compendium of astronomy was a particular favorite of Jewish astronomers; besides being translated into Spanish by Don Abraham Faquin, it was turned into Hebrew by Jacob ben Makir and Solomon ibn Pater Cohen and into Latin by Abraham de Balmes. Other translations from the Arabic were by Jacob Anatoli, Moses Galeno, and Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, bringing the Greco-Arabic astronomers to the notice of western Europe. Jacob Anatoli, for example, translated into Hebrew both the Almagest and Averroes' compendium of it, and this Hebrew version was itself translated into Latin by Jacob Christmann. Other translators from the Hebrew into Latin were Abraham de Balmes and Kalonymus ben David of Naples, while David Kalonymus ben Jacob, Ephraim Mizraḥi, and Solomon Abigdor translated from the Latin into Hebrew. The well-known family of translators, the Ibn Tibbons, may be especially mentioned. In practical astronomy Jewish work was even more effective. Jacob ben Makir (who is known also as Profiat Tibbon) appears to have been professor of Astronomy at Montpellier, about 1300, and to have invented a quadrant to serve as a substitute for the astrolabe. Levi ben Gershon was also the inventor of an astronomical instrument, and is often quoted with respect under the name of Leon de Bañolas. Bonet de Lattes also invented an astronomical ring. Abraham Zacuto ben Samuel was professor of Astronomy at Salamanca, and afterward astronomer-royal to Emmanuel of Portugal, who had previously been advised by a Jewish astronomer, Rabbi Joseph Vecinho, a pupil of Abraham Zacuto, as to the project put before him by Christopher Columbus, who, in carrying it out, made use of Zacuto's \"Almanac\" and \"Tables.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Spence sortied with TG 58.4, the fast carriers, on 6 June, to attack the Mariana Islands. As aircraft struck the islands, the destroyer moved in and bombarded Japanese positions on Guam and Saipan. The planes attacked Iwo Jima on the 16th and then returned to shell the Marianas. Spence participated in the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\" during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. On 23 and 24 June, aircraft bombed targets on Guam, Saipan and Tinian. The destroyer conducted shore bombardment against Rota, Saipan and Guam from 26 June through the end of the month setting fuel tanks afire and sinking two sampans on the 27th. Spence replenished at Eniwetok in July and, on 4 August, sailed for the California coast via Pearl Harbor and arrived at San Francisco on 18 August. She was drydocked all of September and, on 5 October, sailed for Pearl Harbor and the Marshalls. She arrived at Eniwetok on 31 October and was ordered to Ulithi in early November, where she was assigned to TG 38.1, the Support Unit for the fast carriers of TF 38. She screened the carriers in Philippine waters as they launched attacks against Luzon during November and the first part of December.\n\nParagraph 8: Yakir retreated to Ukraine and fought against Austro-Hungarian occupation forces as a commander of a Chinese regiment of the Red Army. He was severely wounded in March 1918 near Ekaterinoslav. At the beginning of the Russian Civil War between Bolshevik forces, the White Army and various other anti-Bolshevik movements, Yakir was a member of the Bolshevik Party in Voronezh Province and started his service in the Red Army as a commissar. He showed military talent and was assigned as a field commander. In October 1918, he served as a member of the Revolutionary Council of the 8th Army in the Southern Front and simultaneously commanded the Southern Front's several key formations in operations against the Don Cossacks of Pyotr Krasnov. He carried out Lenin's order of persecution against the Cossack civilians and the extermination of almost half of the male Cossack population. The war against armed combatants plus the terror against the civilians were coming together in the Russian Civil War. Encouraged by the Bolshevik theory of class struggle, Yakir, like other members of the Communist party, took part in terror. For his services, he became the second individual (after Vasily Blyukher) to receive the highest Soviet military award of that time, the Order of the Red Banner (engraved as No. 2).\n\nParagraph 9: The DOMCO mines were subsumed by the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) in 1920, and BESCO management soon began a targeted campaign to break the union, organized as District 26, United Mine Workers of America. There were many small strikes in the Sydney coalfield between 1920 and 1925, but the longest, in 1925, lasted from March to August. When the latest contract  expired on January 15, 1925, BESCO refused to deal with the union and on March 2 cut off credit at the company stores. The union went on strike four days later, with 12,000 miners manning the picket lines, leaving a small workforce to maintain the mines and keep them from flooding. Despite the economic hardship which saw families come to the brink of starvation by June, the miners' resolve was strong. When BESCO refused arbitration, the union adopted a policy of 100 per cent picketing. This included shutting down operations at the pumping station and power plant at Waterford Lake, which would prevent the company from resuming operations in that district. On June 10, BESCO tasked its company police force to return to Waterford Lake with thirty company workers and continue its plan to restart the water and electricity to its facilities and to the parts of town that had the benefit of running water and power. The following morning on June 11, the company police began a patrol pattern of intimidation which led to small clashes throughout town, culminating in a protest by 700 to 3,000 striking miners who marched on the Waterford Lake in an attempt to persuade the company workers to support the strike. The company police were staring down the miners at 11:00 AM when the police charged the crowd, firing over 300 shots and injuring many. One police officer shot deliberately at Davis, piercing his heart and killing him within minutes. The company police force then retreated as the miners swarmed the facility. The coal miners also began attacking company stores and other coal company properties in the Sydney coalfield, resulting in the deployment of the provincial police force and almost 2,000 soldiers from the Canadian Army - the second-largest military deployment for an internal conflict in Canadian history after the North-West Rebellion of 1885. BESCO eventually accepted government intervention and agreed to settle the strike. BESCO gave up its attempts to break District 26 U.M.W.A., which by then had grown to become one of the most militant labour organizations on the continent. The company was eventually taken over and merged into a larger conglomerate in 1930 called the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO), but Industrial Cape Breton remained a hotbed of labour activism\n\nParagraph 10: In 2018, King played the mother of a murdered black teenager in the Netflix original series Seven Seconds, winning her third Primetime Emmy Award. Her performance in the 2018 film If Beale Street Could Talk, directed by Barry Jenkins, garnered critical acclaim and earned her the Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. King additionally won the Critics' Choice, Los Angeles Film Critics, New York Film Critics, National Society of Film Critics, and numerous other critic awards for Supporting Actress, making her the most awarded actor of 2018 in film. In regards to King's performance, Richard Roeper for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"Regina King is blazingly good in a nomination-worthy performance as Tish’s mother. Even when there’s fire in her eyes as she defends her daughter, you can see her primary motivating force is love. The love she has for her child, and for the child of her child.\" In his review for The Observer, Mark Kermode wrote: \"As for Regina King, her brilliantly modulated performance is a masterclass in physical understatement. One moment stands out [...] 'Mamma… ,' says Tish, tentatively, and even before she turns to face us, an almost imperceptible movement of King’s neck and shoulders tells us that Sharon knows exactly what her daughter is about to say.\""}

Frontier Airlines began operating flights from the airport the following day, connecting it to El Paso and Phoenix, with stops at various cities along the way. Over the years, the airline changed its routes and aircraft, eventually discontinuing its flights to Tucson and Phoenix in 1974. After Frontier, several other commuter airlines operated at the airport, including Zia Airlines, Airways of New Mexico, Mesa Airlines, Great Lakes Airlines, Boutique Air, and Advanced Air. Each airline offered flights to Albuquerque and/or Phoenix, using different aircraft models. Aztec Airlines and Turner Air also briefly served the Silver City to El Paso market."], "answers": ["Paragraph 9", "Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 2"], "context": "Paragraph 1: The development of the chemical process now known as the Wacker process began in 1956 at Wacker Chemie. At the time, many industrial compounds were produced from acetylene, derived from calcium carbide, an expensive and environmentally unfriendly technology. The construction of a new oil refinery in Cologne by Esso close to a Wacker site, combined with the realization that ethylene would be a cheaper raw-material prompted Wacker to investigate its potential uses. As part of the ensuing research effort, a reaction of ethylene and oxygen over palladium on carbon in a quest for ethylene oxide unexpectedly gave evidence for the formation of acetaldehyde (simply based on smell). More research into this ethylene to acetaldehyde conversion resulted in a 1957 patent describing a gas-phase reaction using a heterogeneous catalyst. In the meanwhile Hoechst AG joined the race and after a patent filing forced Wacker into a partnership called Aldehyd GmbH. The heterogeneous process ultimately failed due to catalyst inactivation and was replaced by the water-based homogeneous system for which a pilot plant was operational in 1958. Problems with the aggressive catalyst solution were solved by adopting titanium (newly available for industrial use) as construction material for reactors and pumps. Production plants went into operation in 1960.\n\nParagraph 2: The Grant County Airport was dedicated on November 30, 1951, serving the communities of Silver City, Hurley, Lordsburg, and Deming, New Mexico, as well as smaller communities in the so-called \"Mining District,\" including Arenas Valley, Fort Bayard, Central (now Santa Clara), Bayard, and Santa Rita.The next day, on December 1, 1951 Frontier Airlines began operating flights from the airport as a stop on their route from El Paso to Phoenix, which also included stops at Clifton, Safford, and Tucson, Arizona. Before the opening of the Grant County Airport, the airline was serving local airports in Deming, NM and Lordsburg, NM; however, service to those cities was then discontinued. By 1956 the route to Phoenix was modified to originate in Albuquerque rather than El Paso and service to Clifton and Safford was later discontinued which made for nonstop flights from Silver City to Tucson and Phoenix. At that time and on into the mid-1960s, the airline was flying the Douglas DC-3. Later, Frontier served the airport with larger Convair 340 prop aircraft followed by Convair 580 turboprops. Frontier's flights to Tucson and Phoenix were discontinued in 1974 and a small commuter carrier, Zia Airlines, began flights to Albuquerque with Cessna 402 and Handley Page Jetstream propjets in 1976. In the midst of growing into an all jet airline, Frontier ended their service in late 1979. Zia Airlines went out of business in early 1980 and Air Midwest began operating later that year under an Essential Air Service (EAS) contract with flights to Albuquerque using Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Another commuter, Airways of New Mexico, operated flights to El Paso for a short time in 1980 as well. In 1985 the EAS contract was shifted from Air Midwest to Mesa Airlines which came to Silver City with service to Albuquerque using Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900D. Mesa's flights continued for 20 years until 2005 when the EAS contract was awarded to Great Lakes Airlines. Great Lakes started service with flights to Albuquerque, also using Beech 1900D's, but switched the flights to Phoenix in late 2012. Great Lakes ended all service in late 2014 and the EAS contract was then awarded to Boutique Air which began service in early 2015. Boutique provided flights to both Albuquerque and Phoenix using Pilatus PC-12 aircraft for four years until the EAS contract was then transferred to Advanced Air. Advanced Air began service in early 2019 with similar service to Albuquerque and Phoenix but uses a larger, multi engine, Beechcraft Super King Air model 350. Two other commuter airlines that served the Silver City to El Paso market for short periods were Aztec Airlines in 1966 and Turner Air in 1985.\n\nParagraph 3: Turk had for some time been leading a faction within the Communist Party that demanded a more positive view of Arab nationalism, in opposition to Secretary-General Khalid Bakdash, who ruled the party with an iron fist. In 1972, Bakdash decided to merge the party into the National Progressive Front, a coalition of organizations allied with the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party. Along with supporters on the radical wing of the party, Turk formed the Syrian Communist Party (Political Bureau), consolidating a split that had been apparent since the late 1960s. The SCP-Political Bureau initially negotiated with the government for terms of legalization and membership in the Front. However, it later took a strong opposition stance, especially from 1976 on after the Syrian intervention in favour of the Maronites right-wing government in the Lebanese Civil War. This led to repression of the party, which was stepped up at the beginning of the 1980s when the Hafez al-Assad government felt itself under increasing pressure from both Islamists and the secular opposition. Al-Turk was arrested and imprisoned on 28 October 1980 and held under very difficult conditions for almost 18 years. He spent most of this period in solitary confinement and suffering regular torture. Based on interviews with al-Turk journalist Robin Wright reports he was \"locked way in a windowless underground cell, about the length of his body or the size of a small elevator compartment, at an intelligence headquarters.\" Al-Turk was \"never allowed out of his cell to exercise. Until the final months, he was not allowed a book, newspaper, mail or anything else to keep his mind occupied.\" For the first thirteen years of his imprisonment he was allowed no communication from, or information about, his friends and family, including his two young daughters. His \"only activity was being allowed three times a day to go to a shared toilet.\" He was never allowed to use it when other prisoners were there but did scrounge the toilet bin for discarded clothing as his own clothing was worn out.  One of his few diversions was collecting grains of dark cereal he found in the thin soup he was served in the evening and using the grains to create pictures in his cell.  He suffered considerable ill-health, including diabetes for which he was refused treatment. He was released on 30 May 1998.\n\nParagraph 4: The credit against the federal tax may be reduced if the state has an outstanding advance (commonly called a \"loan\"). When states lack the funds to pay unemployment insurance, they may obtain loans from the federal government. To ensure that these loans are repaid and in accordance with Title XII of the Social Security Act, the federal government is entitled to recover them by reducing the FUTA credit it gives to employers, which is the equivalent of an overall increase in the FUTA tax. When a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years, and the full amount of the loan is not repaid by November 10 of the second year, the FUTA credit will be reduced until the loan is repaid. That process is commonly called FUTA credit reduction and was designed as an involuntary repayment mechanism. The reduction schedule is 0.3% for the first year and an additional 0.3% for each succeeding year until the loan is repaid. From the third year onward, there may be additional reduction(s) in the FUTA tax credit (commonly dubbed \"add-ons\"). For example, for taxable years 2012 and 2013, the Virgin Islands had a 2.7% \"add-on\" when its tax rate on total wages was below a national minimum. For taxable year 2014, Connecticut had a \"BCR add-on\" when its tax rate on the taxable portion of covered wages in the previous calendar year was less than the 5-year benefit–cost ratio applicable for the taxable year.\n\nParagraph 5: In terms of MBT's there are 5 types in NATO that are modern enough for a peer conflict with Russia that are talked about below. The majority of NATO members use the Leopard 2 as their main tank, with some countries such as Spain and Poland having their own variants. The Leopard 2A4 is the most widely used variant but this is the least modern variant in current use. NATO also uses the variants developed after the 2A4: the 2A5, 2A6 and 2A7. The US M1 Abrams tank is mainly used by the US, although Poland uses them alongside their Leopard 2's. This makes Poland the only NATO country other than the US to operate the Abrams. The M1 Abrams is in service in large numbers with the US army and the Leopard 2 is in widespread service throughout NATO, making these tank types the bulk of NATO's armoured strength. Other tanks that are available in small numbers are the Challenger 2, Leclerc and Ariete. These tanks are only used in NATO by their respective countries. There are roughly 200 tanks in service for each tank type, making a total of 800, plus roughly 1500 Leopard 2's and roughly 2500 M1 Abrams, the majority of which are M1A2's and the rest M1A1's. Therefore, roughly half of NATO's tank strength is composed of American M1 Abrams tanks and the other half of European Leopard 2s  with smaller amounts of Challenger 2's, Leclerc's and Ariete's. While the tanks previously listed are the main NATO tank forces, other NATO members operate obsolete Cold War era tanks from both the West and the Soviet Union. Some of those Soviet tanks are domestic variants of an original Soviet design. The countries that operate these tanks also do not have the ability to deploy them abroad so they still could not be used in NATO operations against poorly armed opponents where they might be useful. In terms of infantry fighting vehicles, there is slightly more variety due to the lower cost when compared to a tank. The US M2 Bradley makes up a substantial amount of infantry fighting vehicles in NATO with the US operating roughly 6,000. Other IFV's in NATO have hundreds of each type depending on which exact one present in NATO. These IFV's are the Puma, Warrior, Dardo, Freccia, ASCOD, Combat Vehicle 90, VBCI, LAV III,BMP-1and the BMP-2. The total for all these IFV's is roughly around 5000, meaning the US has roughly half of NATO's IFV's. The previous list does not include anything that could be described as an IFV but is not classified as such, like a Stryker, Boxer or Piranha. In terms of other armoured fighting vehicles, a lot of NATO members operate wheeled APC's and IFV's to carry infantry, the difference being an IFV would be employed with an infantry squad that was meant to work with tanks and a wheeled APC would be employed with independent infantry that were not supposed to cooperate with any tanks. These are the Stryker, Boxer and Piranha as mentioned earlier and the Patria AMV, Patria Pasi, Pandur II and Pandur I. The majority of modern wheeled Armored fighting vehicles in NATO are Strykers at roughly 4,500. The next most widely available wheeled APC is the Patria AMV, with Poland having a large amount (roughly 1000 vehicles) and other NATO members employing much smaller numbers. Next is the Boxer with roughly 800 in NATO use, with that number going up to 1400 by 2022, as the British Army ordered roughly 600 additional vehicles. The second least used is the MOWAG Piranha with roughly 500 in service in NATO. The modern wheeled AFV in the smallest numbers in NATO is the Pandur II with 250. The majority is used by Portugal and a smaller amount is used by Czechoslovakia. Slovenia has also made a request for 14 Pandur II as they already operate Pandur I. Older vehicles still in use as APC's but with tracks are the M113 armored personnel carrier and ELVO Leonidas-2. Most AFV's can also be configured into specialist vehicles as in most militaries.\n\nParagraph 6: Vision span or perceptual span is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the human eye has sharp enough vision to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The visual field of the human eye spans approximately 120 degrees of arc.  However, most of that arc is peripheral vision. The human eye has much greater resolution in the macula, where there is a higher density of cone cells.  The macula has a diameter of about 16 degrees of the retina.  The field of view that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6 degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50 centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the field of view with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face. The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.\n\nParagraph 7: The song is a slow and sultry song, which blends hip-hop and contemporary R&B genres. It incorporates drum notes, including heavy beats and grooves. The song's second version features a rap version from Mobb Deep. The song samples the melody from \"Shook Ones Part II\" by Mobb Deep, incorporating it into chorus and bridge. As part of \"layering the song,\" background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. It is set in the signature common time, and is written in the key of B-flat minor. It features a basic chord progression of A-F1. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of F5; the piano and guitar pieces range from F3 to G5 as well. The song contains lyrics written by Carey, who produced the song's melody and chorus as well. Aside from assisting with its chord progression, Cory Rooney co-arranged and produced the track as well. Author Chris Nickson felt the song was extremely important for Carey's musical transition, writing \"Lyrically, this was some of her best work ever, the melody slinky and overtly sexy, confirmation – as if any was needed at this point! – that this was the new Mariah.\"\n\nParagraph 8: Receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago in 1960, Flaumenhaft went on to achieve a Master of Arts degree (1962) and the Ph.D. in political science (1980) also from the University of Chicago. He served as both a Woodrow Wilson and a NASA Fellow. He has held positions as a lecturer at Roosevelt University and the University of Chicago, and as an instructor in government at Wheaton College. He has held his current position at St. John's College since 1968. Flaumenhaft has also served as a visiting professor in the Department of Educational Studies at the University of Delaware.\n\nParagraph 9: The square symmetrical  towers are in the neoclassical style, resembling tall pavilions rather than towers, with each facade pedimented and the whole surmounted by a cupola decorated with blind windows interspersed by Ionic columns. At ground floor level two unfluted ionic columns at each corner support a decorative cornice. The columns are decorative only, and appear to serve no structural purpose. The design of the towers creates the impression that the building was once more of a miniature cathedral than a parish church.  However, the main body of the church was small and occupied the (now empty) site between the two towers. It was a single storey structure with a simple hipped roof and entrance porticos at its centre.  This was the part of Adam's church which was demolished in 1870. The remaining towers are Grade I listed and a scheduled monument.\n\nParagraph 10: This history, Scalia concluded, clearly shows that the Confrontation Clause was directed at keeping \"ex parte\" examinations out of the evidentiary record. Specifically, the Confrontation Clause applies to \"witnesses\" against the accused, meaning those who \"bear testimony.\" Relying on this and the historical record, Scalia stated, \"the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\" Scalia determined that a prior opportunity for cross-examination was mandatory, and dispositive of whether or not testimonial statements of an unavailable witness are admissible. Testimonial statements are formal declarations, i.e., those made to law enforcement or government personnel. \"Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\""}

Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. Of greatest importance, it sponsored the Erie Canal, which began operations in 1825, forming a continuous water route from New York north to Albany via the Hudson River, then west to Buffalo using the new canal to reach the Great Lakes.  It opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest. New York set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes to the highest bidder. Exporters from Britain discovered New York offered the best prices for their goods, and they increasingly ignored Boston and Philadelphia, where the local merchants tried to impose higher markups by avoiding auctions.  New York began the world's first regular packet service to England with the Black Ball Line in 1818. By 1830, it dominated the nation's merchant marine.  Ambitious shippers reached beyond the natural hinterland to open large-scale coastal trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for export to textile mills in the Northeast and in Europe, and carried manufactured products to the South. By 1830, 40 cents of every dollar the mills paid for cotton went to New York brokers to cover the cost of shipping. The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up. Manufacturing was not a major factor in the city's growth in the 19th century—factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities with waterfalls and fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies.\n\nParagraph 2: stated by the Church Committee to renovate the building. Approval was accorded by the then Chief Electrical Engineer, Janab M.Hayath, during his visit to Jog in the month of November 1948, for renovating the building, as it was required by rules. An appeal for funds, approved by His Lordship the Bishop of Mysore, was sent up all round. The Catholic workers of Jog, though poor, readily responded to the appeal by contributing their mite both by cash and free labour. The mound all around the Chapel was levelled by the voluntary labour of the Catholics, the cost of which was then estimated to about Rs. 1500/-. Then the mud walled Chapel was dismantled and the foundation for the Church was laid by His Lordship on 2 June 1948. The construction of the Church was entrusted to Government Contractor Sriyuths V. Lakkanna and Krishna lyengar, who did the work on most economic and concessional rates, and the work was completed by the end of 1949. During the construction of the Church, Mass was being said in Mr. D'Sa's Bungalow. The total cost of the building excluding free labour (free labour was estimated at about Rs. 2000/-) was about Rs.2500/- In the efforts were continued for collecting funds, both for the construction and maintenance of the Church. and Mr. & Mrs. D’Sa along with the Committee members, paid personal interest in collecting funds both from and outside Jog. Mr. D’Sa took keen interest in collecting funds even from Mangalore and other places, Mr. J.L.D’Sa was in direct management of Church affairs, as the President of the Catholic Association, from the year 1945 to 1955 November, when he was transferred to Bangalore on promotion as the Chief Electrical Engineer.

Mrs Luttrell recovers, and the incident has a good effect on their marriage. Next, Hastings is concerned that his daughter Judith spends time with Major Allerton, a married man. While Hastings and Elizabeth are out with birdwatcher Stephen Norton, Norton sees something through his binoculars that disturbs him. Hastings assumes it has to do with Allerton. When his attempts to persuade Judith to give Allerton up merely antagonise her, the worried father plans Allerton's murder. He falls asleep while waiting to poison Allerton, relieved he took no action when he awakes the next day. Last, Barbara Franklin, wife of Judith's employer, Dr Franklin, dies the following evening. She was poisoned with physostigmine sulphate, an extract from the Calabar bean that her husband researches. Poirot's testimony at the inquest, that Mrs Franklin had been upset and that he saw her emerge from Dr Franklin's laboratory with a small bottle, persuades the jury to return a verdict of suicide.\n\nParagraph 4: The Uskok attack on the Sanjak of Krka deeply angered both the Muslim population and the Ottoman administration in the region. Ibrahim, Sanjak-bey of Krka, went to Constantinople to make conversations with high ranking officials. He asked for compensation for the damage caused by Uskok incursions. Ottoman officials asked for reports on the issue from the Venetian ambassador in Istanbul, as from the Ottomans' point of view the Uskok raiders were subjected to the Republic of Venice. But the Venetian ambassador rejected the accusations and said that the Uskoks were subjected to the Holy Roman Empire. Ibrahim then requested that a letter be written to the German emperor complaining about the damage caused by Uskoks, in accordance with the Ahidnâme. The Ottoman Grand Vizier commissioned Telli Hasan Pasha, who had been newly appointed as Beylerbey of Bosnia, to make investigation on the issue. No letter written to the Holy Roman Empire regarding the Krka raid has been found in the archives. Regardless of whether the letter was sent or not, it is clear that the Ottomans could not find anyone who would make talks on the issue, and soon they began to prepare for war in order to take revenge from both the Uskok raiders and their supporters.\n\nParagraph 5: A blonde Daughter of the Moon and Daughter of Pandora, who stars in Goddess of the Night (Book #1), Moon Demon (Book #7) where she finds out that she started to fall in love with what Jimena's grandmother called the devil, and The Final Eclipse (Book #13).  As a Daughter of the Moon, she is able to expand her molecules and become invisible. Occasionally, she can move objects while she is invisible, but it takes a lot of concentration. Originally, Vanessa was cautious about using her power, which caused her to have very poor control over it. However, throughout the series, she becomes more comfortable using it although she is still affected by strong emotions, such as fear. She lives with her mother, a Hollywood costume designer. Her father was a stunt coordinator who died when she was five in an accident. Vanessa is portrayed as being intelligent and always trying to see the best of people, such as Morgan Page who is consistently rude to Vanessa's other friends. Her best friend is Catty Turner, whom she has known since they were both children. She dates Michael Saratoga on and off throughout the series. In book 4, she starts to date Toby, a Regulator, who wants the Secret Scroll destroyed but he endangers all of the girls, including Vanessa. Fortunately, he is ultimately killed in the end. In book 7, Vanessa starts to date a mysterious guy named Hector, who later turns out to be a moon demon. He tries to marry her so she can live with him for eternity, but she frees him from his bonds to the Atrox, causing his death. In the same book, Vanessa reveals a talent for singing and joins Michael's band. Also her birthday is revealed to be November 14. In book 13, Vanessa returns from Nefandus after being held prisoner there for many months and discovers her 17th birthday is a few days away. After she helps to defeat the Atrox she is faced with the choice of becoming a guardian spirit or losing her memories of what she is and her powers. She makes the choice of losing her memories and her powers.\n\nParagraph 6: He was educated at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, and at Auckland Teachers College.  He subsequently worked as a teacher in Fiji, before going into the civil service where he served from 1972 to 1980 in a number of government departments.  He was also a member of the Council of the University of the South Pacific in Suva from 1974 to 1980.  He was Fiji's Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations from 1980 to 1983, when he became a project administrator of the Pacific Islands Development Program in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he remained till 1986.\n\nParagraph 7: Eazy-Duz-It was released on November 23, 1988. The album received very little attention from radio and television stations, but got support from Los Angeles's hip-hop underground. On May 20, 1989, it peaked at #41 on the Billboard 200, and since 1989, was in various places on the chart for over 90 weeks. It peaked at #12 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on March 11, 1989. Since the album's release, it has been on the chart during 51 different weeks. On February 15, 1989, the album was certified Gold (500,000 sales) by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on June 1, 1989, it was certified Platinum (1,000,000 sales). It received its peak certification by the RIAA of Double Platinum (2,000,000 sales) on September 1, 1992. In 1989, it had sold over 650,000 copies, and by early 1995, Eazy-Duz-It had sold 2.5 million copies. On February 11, 1989, \"We Want Eazy\" charted on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 43. It stayed on the chart for over 15 weeks. The song also charted at number seven on the Hot Rap Songs chart. \"Eazy-er Said Than Dunn\", the album's 3rd single, peaked at number 84 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts on May 6, 1989, where it would maintain some lower position on the chart for six weeks. \"Eazy-Duz-It\" charted on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number 39. In August 2015, a couple weeks after the release of the N.W.A. biopic film, Straight Outta Compton, the album re-entered the chart at #32 on the Billboard 200, out-peaking its original peak position in 1989 when it charted at #41 on the Billboard 200.\n\nParagraph 8: The Panther faithful had little time to savor the 1936 (8–1–1) football season and Rose Bowl victory, due to a winter of discontent in the athletic department. On Monday February 22, Joe Williams of the New York World-Telegram broke a story about a rift between Coach Jock Sutherland, and Athletic Director Don Harrison that took place at the Rose Bowl. In essence, the coach wanted spending money for the team but the athletic director refused. Mr. Harrison's final statement was: \"I made you, now I'm going to break you.\" Sutherland ended up giving the team money out of his own pocket. Coach Sutherland stated that he would resign \"rather than embroil the University of Pittsburgh in a controversy which is neither dignified nor to the best interests of the institution.\" Mr. Harrison denied the story was factual, but on March 20 his resignation was accepted by the Athletic Council, much to the dismay of Chancellor Dr. John G. Bowman. Dr. Bowman sent three points of athletic policy to the Athletic Council. The third point made clear what the Chancellor thought of subsidizing athletes. \"Much discussion of athletics centers around the subsidization of athletes. Much of this talk is nonsense. The University of Pittsburgh should join with other institutions to maintain high and right standards of amateur college athletics. I cannot express to you too strongly my desire that the University shall discourage the giving of special help to students who have nothing to recommend them but athletic ability. On the other hand, the University through the recommendations, chiefly of high school principals and of Senators of the Commonwealth, grants help to more than 2000 students. In these grants there should be no discrimination for or against a boy merely because he has athletic ability. In other words, you are charged with the responsibility to discourage any subsidies, from whatever source, to students merely because of athletic ability.\" On May 3 Dr. Bowman named James Hagan, a letterman halfback on Sutherland's 1925-27 teams, to the office of Athletic Director. Hagan had been Harrison's assistant for the previous 8 years, occupying the office of Graduate Manager of Athletics.  He took office in July and immediately presented his nine point policy to the Athletic Council. The infamous \"Hagan Plan\", which Sutherland claimed he had not seen until he read it in the newspaper in October, was accepted by the athletic council and lauded by Chancellor Bowman. It would be the downfall of Pitt football for decades. The major problems were the players would be subsidized, but they would have to work two hours a day to earn it and the schedule would be only eight games a season. Sutherland thought the schedule would not be against major powers but lesser competition to equal the talent that he would be recruiting. That would not be the case. The minor issues were that Sutherland could no longer write newspaper articles or do radio ads to make extra money; Sutherland had no control over the schedule; Camp Hamilton fall practice was abolished; and Sutherland could not recruit off campus.\n\nParagraph 9: One of the show trials involving charges of \"wrecking\" was that of official coordinators of the 1937 Soviet Census. The census was organised with great expectations from the government that it would confirm the superiority of the Soviet economic and social model, with Stalin publicly declaring in 1934 that the Soviet Union was gaining at least 3 million citizens per year. The census questions and procedure were prepared for several years by a commission of professional statisticians and demographers, but then significantly changed by Stalin and other members of the Central Committee to better match their political goals – the collection phase of the census was shortened and the procedures simplified.\n\nParagraph 10: On May 6, 2010 Blair and Tea have a confrontation that forever changes their prior relationship as enemies. Blair made a copy of Tea's medical records. She found out Tea was going to die of a brain tumor, so she invited Tea over to her mansion to discuss Tea's illness, apologize for how she has treated Tea in the past, and offer to help however she can. However, Tea is initially furious to find out Blair has copied her medical files, and threatens to sue. Blair says Tea can fight her all she wants. Tea assumes Blair cannot wait for her to die, so she can return to her old flame—Todd Manning. Blair says she has no intention of getting back together with Todd, and says she does not want Tea to die. Tea tries to push Blair away, even physically. Blair fights to contain Tea. Tea breaks down in Blair's arms. They cry together, and Blair tells Tea she will help however she can. Subsequently, Blair convinces Tea to seek medical treatment for her tumor. Tea initially fights her on the subject, but eventually gives in. Later, Blair invites Tea and Danielle over to get ready for prom with Danielle's older sister Starr (Kristen Alderson). Blair and Tea spend some quality time together and bond once the kids leave for prom. Shortly thereafter, Blair takes Tea to her first radiation treatment. Several weeks later, Blair finds Tea passed out lying on the floor of her hotel room, and she gets her to the hospital. Blair promises to make sure Danielle is a part of her family, once Tea dies, and she comforts Tea. Weeks later, Tea calls Blair over to ask Blair to be Danielle's legal guardian in case something happens to Todd. Blair promises to always be there for Danielle. Blair and Tea share an emotional goodbye with a memorable montage of some of their history together."}
{"queries": ["The text describes the history and development of Bromley Common in the 1500s to the 1860s. Initially, it consisted of farmland and estates owned by large landowners. The Bishops of Rochester owned the common but allowed various \"commoners\" to enjoy its privileges. The common was about 300 acres in size and stretched along the main road from Tunbridge Wells and Hastings to Bromley and London. Highwaymen were known to frequent the area for profitable activities. In 1821, an Act of Parliament enclosed the common, leading to some limited residential development mainly to the south of the old common.

There are suspicions surrounding a character named Madan, and his relationship with Kalindi raises Angad's jealousy. The Brahmarakshas kills Inspector Shabana, and Angad vows to expose the truth. It is revealed that Uma is actually Kalindi from Angad's childhood. Madan warns Kalindi not to marry Angad as Brahmarakshas can take anyone's form. Paridhi agrees to help Kalindi by taking her place at the wedding. Brahmarakshas wounds Madan but is killed by Kalindi. However, Brahmarakshas is shown to be alive.

The Qing identified their state as Zhongguo, meaning \"central state\" in Chinese, and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu and \"China\" in English. They considered their lands, including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and other territories under their control, as part of China, defining it as a multi-ethnic state. After conquering Xinjiang, they incorporated it into China and celebrated the expansion of territory. The Qing rejected the notion that China only encompassed Han-populated areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of China. They used terms like \"Chinese language\" to encompass Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"people of China\" to include Han, Manchus, Mongols, and other subjects of the Qing. The Qing promoted the idea of uniting different ethnic groups, emphasizing that they were part of one family within the Qing state. They employed the phrases \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" and \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" to convey the concept of unification. The Qianlong Emperor also critiqued earlier beliefs that only Han people could be China's subjects, stating that this was not the understanding of the Qing dynasty. The term \"China\" was used in foreign communications and treaties with other states and first appeared in a Qing government document in 1689. Despite their efforts for unity, the Qing implemented different strategies for legitimizing different ethnic groups within the empire."], "answers": ["Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 5", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Further terms in office lasted from 11 August 1964 to 6 August 1969, and from 25 June 1972 to 8 December 1987. During the 1960s, Hassan addressed the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization twice, opposing Spain's claim for Gibraltar and insisting that the vast majority of Gibraltarians wanted to remain British. He was one of the members of the 1968 Constitutional Conference chaired by Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd, which drafted the Gibraltar's first Constitution. Hassan only lost one election, the 1969 election, when the AACR failed to win a majority by just one seat, as it only obtained seven of the fifteen seats of the House. The Integration with Britain Party (IWBP, supporter of the integration of Gibraltar into the United Kingdom) gained support from the independent members of the House of Assembly and its leader Robert Peliza became Chief Minister and remained so for three years. Hassan was returned to office in 1972. He resigned without completing his term as Chief Minister in 1987 after an agreement on the shared use of Gibraltar Airport was signed by Spain and the United Kingdom, citing personal reasons. He was succeeded by the then Deputy Chief Minister, Adolfo Canepa. However, Canepa lost the 1988 election to Joe Bossano of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP) and the AACR disbanded shortly afterwards. Bossano was one of Hassan's main critics, accusing him of being too conciliatory towards the British Government.\n\nParagraph 2: She evidently was close to Isabella de' Medici, and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals, all at Venice. Sometime during this period she married a man named Mezari, but no other information is known about him, or where she (or they) were living. Evidently she visited Verona, Milan and Florence, based on information contained in dedications, and likely she went to Venice as well, since her music was published there and numerous Venetians commented on her abilities. She made at least one voyage to the French imperial court in the 1570s.\n\nParagraph 3: The Qing identified their state as Zhongguo (\"中國\", lit. \"central state\", the term for \"China\" in modern Chinese), and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu and \"China\" in English. The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and other areas under Qing control) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state. After the Qing conquered Xinjiang in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land was now absorbed into \"China\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial. The Qianlong Emperor explicitly commemorated the Qing conquest of the Dzungars as having added new territory in Xinjiang to Zhongguo, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han-populated areas in \"China proper\", meaning that according to the Qing, both Han and non-Han peoples were part of China (Zhongguo). Similarly, the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, while the term \"people of China\" (中國之人 Zhongguo zhi ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, Mongol, and other subjects of the Qing. The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the \"outer\" non-Han peoples like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the \"inner\" Han people, into \"one family\" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" (中外一家) or \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" (內外一家, \"interior and exterior as one family\"), to convey this idea of \"unification\" of the different peoples. The Qianlong Emperor rejected earlier ideas that only Han people could be subjects of China and only Han lands could be considered as part of China, saying in 1755 that \"There exists a view of China (Zhongxia), according to which non-Han people cannot become China's subjects and their land cannot be integrated into the territory of China. This does not represent our dynasty's understanding of China, but is instead that of the earlier Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties.\" The term \"Zhongguo\" or \"China\" was also used extensively to refer to the Qing in foreign communications and treaties with other states. It appeared in a formal Qing government document for the first time in the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk signed with the Russians. Nevertheless, the Qing implemented different ways of legitimization for different peoples in the Qing Empire, such as acting as Khagan to the Mongols instead of as Huangdi to these non-Han subjects.\n\nParagraph 4:  The Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network, founded in 2011 and consists of more than 16,000 members as of 2019, is a Citizen Science project where roadkill across Taiwan is photographed and sent to the Endemic Species Research Institute for study. Its primary goal has been to set up an eco-friendly path to mitigate roadkill challenges and popularize national discourse on environmental issues and civil participation in scientific research. The members of the Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network volunteer to observe the animals' corpses caused by roadkill or other reasons in Taiwan, and upload pictures and geographic locations of the roadkill to an internet database or send the corpses to the Endemic Species Research for making specimen. Because the members come from different areas of the island, the collection of data could serve as an animal distribution map of the island. According to the geographical data and pictures of dead animals collected by the members, the community itself and the sponsor the Endemic Species Center could find out the hotspots and the reasons of animals' death. One of the most renowned case is that the community successfully detected rabies cases due to the massively collected data and the corpse of Melogale moschata have been accumulated for years and alarmed the government authority to take actions to prevent the prevalence of rabies in Taiwan immediately. Another case in 2014 that some citizen scientists discovered birds that died from unknown causes near an agricultural area, then Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network cooperated with National Pingtung University of Science and Technology and engaged citizen scientists to collect bird carcass. The volunteers collected 250 bird corpses for laboratory tests, which confirmed that the bird deaths were attributable to the pesticides used on crops. This prompted the Taiwanese government to restrict pesticides, and the Bill of Pesticide Management amendment, establishing a pesticide control system, was passed after the third reading in the Legislative Yuan. The results indicated that Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network developed a set of shared working methods and jointly completed certain actions. Furthermore, the community of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network have made real changes on road resign to avoid roadkill, improved the management of usage of pesticide, epidemic prevention, and so on.\n\nParagraph 5: Brahmarakshas is revealed to be alive. Angad and Paridhi's haldi ceremony takes place. Madan comes out of the coma. The Brahmarakshas wreaks havoc again. Kalindi and Angad get Madan home. Angad gets jealous seeing Madan and Kalindi getting closer. The inspector learns something suspicious about Madan. Later, Kalindi seeks Madan's help. Angad gets a doubt on Madan. The incident at the mall raises Angad's suspicion on Madan. When the coconut turns black, Shalini thinks that Prithvi is Brahmarakshas. Brahmarakshas kills Inspector Shabana and Angad vows to expose the truth. Mahamaya Ma tells Shalini that Brahmarakshas is in the house. Angad summons Brahmarakshas and inadvertently saves Balan's life. Later, in a trance, Balan conveys Brahmarakshas's message and tries to kill Prithvi. Angad tries to explain to Kalindi that Madan is Brahmarakshas. Angad learns that Uma is his childhood friend Kalindi. Later, Kalindi learns Prithvi's truth and rushes to save Madan. Madan is saved by Kalindi but Brahmarakshas appears. Meanwhile, Damini stops Angad's marriage with Paridhi and shows everyone a video of Paridhi and Sid together, surprising everyone. Angad leaves the wedding and goes to find Kalindi and saves her from the Brahmarakshas. It is then revealed that After the trio return home, Prithvi fakes getting a heart attack and told everyone that Uma is Kalindi and that Kalindi should marry Angad and the preparation for Angad and Kalindi's starts. Meanwhile, Madan tells Kalindi not to marry Angad as Brahmarakshas could take anyone's form and he could take Angad's form and marry her so its not safe for her. Angad, Kalindi, Minty, Robin, Sakshi and Paridhi go for a picnic in the jungle. Where Paridhi learns of Kalindi's plan of leaving her wedding with Angad and marrying Madan. Paridhi agrees to help her by taking her place at the wedding with Angad. Angad realises the truth and goes to stop Madan and Kalindi's wedding. Brahmarakshas appears and wounds Madan but Kalindi manages to kill Brahmarakshas and Madan dies as well. Then Brahmarakshas is shown jumping out of the fire and is revealed to be alive. Prithvi tells Kalindi that Vikram is guilty of Raghav's death. Kalindi's words hurt Minty and she leaves the house for Robin. A revelation about Robin takes place, he is revealed as Brahmarakshas. Vikram dies by burning in front of everyone. Prithvi and Shalini go to a tantric. Kalindi gives consent to Robin and Minty's relationship and their Roka ceremony takes place. Later, Kalindi uses the solution given in the book to identify Brahmarakshas. Brahmarakshas saves Kalindi from the tantric. Kalindi learns that Robin is Brahmarakshas. Later, when the news of Brahamarakshas' death is broadcast on TV, Kalindi does not believe it. Kalindi tries to make everyone aware of Robin's truth. Later, Robin tells Kalindi that he is Brahmarakshas. A revelation about Brahmarakshas takes place while Angad announces his intention to marry Kalindi. Along with the kids, Kalindi makes a plan against Brahmarakshas. Due to Brahmarakshas, Kalindi gets proven wrong before Angad during the sangeet ceremony. Later, Angad sets the ‘granth’ on fire. Kalindi decides to sacrifice herself to save Robin. During Minty's haldi ceremony, Angad suspects that Kalindi has made a plan and asks her to tell the truth. Later, Brahmarakshas accepts Kalindi's condition. Kalindi saves Robin and puts an end to Brahmarakshas. Later, she falls prey to Prithvi's plan. And is later declared dead.\n\nParagraph 6: A hamlet was present here by the 1500s. Until the 1860s, Bromley Common consisted mainly of farmland and the estates of a few large landowners. The common itself was owned by the Bishops of Rochester as Lords of the Manor, but on the condition that various ‘commoners’ should be allowed to freely enjoy their privileges on it. It amounted to about 300 acres, extending irregularly along the sides of the road that formed the main route from Tunbridge Wells and Hastings to Bromley and, beyond, to London. It was a well-known and profitable haunt for highwaymen. After the common was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1826 (the Act was passed in 1821), there was some limited residential development, but this was mostly to the south of the old common, where it fanned out from the main road. A substantial number of homes had been built around Oakley Road and Princes Plain, such that in 1842 Holy Trinity Church, at the junction of Bromley Common and Oakley Road, was built to cater for the expanding population. In the northern section of the old common development was much more modest, with just a few dozen homes put up along the east side of the road.\n\nParagraph 7: As it is an adaptation, several differences occurred mainly motivated by the available budget and also for cultural reasons. In the first phase, the number of characters in several centers was reduced and several story lines were cut. The number of girls at the young cast was reduced from 10 to 8 and the early entry of the male cast into the orphanage, which in Argentina took place in the middle of the second season. In 1998, the visual identity of the two versions was standardized and unified. While in Argentina the telenovela was in its fourth season, in Brazil the telenovela was passing through the transition between the first and second seasons. The length of the seasons was also different. The first season was aired in Brazil in 1997, the second was broken between 1997 and 1998 and the third and fourth were shortened, being merged and aired between the second half of 1998 and all year of 1999. In the Brazilian adaptation, several plots were cut or reallocated to other characters. Or new and exclusive plots were chosen that would serve as basis to the last two Argentine seasons. But the biggest difference was about the start of the fifth season, which aired in 1999 in Argentina and in 2000 in Brazil. As at the end of 1998, Romina Yan decided not to renew her contract with Telefé to dedicate herself to other more adult projects, the original version had to undergo a reboot and end the first cycle at the end of that season. And so, the so-called first cycle ended. However, this did not happen in Brazil, as Flávia Monteiro renewed her contract for another two years at the end of 1998.Due this, the producers of the plot decided that the Bélen/Carol  would not end there and Raio de Luz could move for the third time and some and some characters would continue in the fifth season and the base of the structure of the history would be maintained. However, fully adapted and changed at the majority of the plots and for their maintenance, with Carolina and the young cast moving to a farm. Plus, the fifth season was the last one in Brazil, as the partnership between SBT and Telefé was not renewed, since the cost of the telenovela was practically all paid in US dollars, due the outsourcing of story production. Another thing was the fact that Argentinian economy already showed signs that it would collapse in a short time. Meanwhile, to SBT save money chose to produce Brazilian versions of know Televisa productions, as the Mexican network made high investments on these adaptations to compete with Globo's primetime and also because the texts had already been adapted for some years and archived due the successive financial crises of the channel. But the main factor for the non-renewal of the contract is that the soap opera that was a profitable product for the channel began to lose audience and revenue during the previous season when most of the original characters had ended their plots. The idea of taking the production to Brazil was taken into account, because the story needed to be finished. January 2001. Thus, the sixth and seventh seasons were not adapted in Brazil. The original sixth season was aired in SBT in 2007, seven years after the series had ended and three years since the reruns (which aired for only a few months because of legal problems) and again attracted huge ratings.\n\nParagraph 8: General Thuần greatly underestimated the strength and tenacity with which the PAVN 9th Division would defend An Dien, although he had accurate intelligence concerning the size, composition, and location of his enemy. His initial plans, which proved unrealistic, called for virtually simultaneous recapture of the three lost bases by about 22 May. Except for the few ARVN infantry and engineers that were thrown across the Thi Thinh River to reinforce the An Dien bridgehead, the first major ARVN unit to move into the Triangle was a battalion of the 43rd Infantry Regiment, 18th Division, which crossed on Route 14 north of Phú Cường. Shortly reinforced by the rest of the regiment, this element, followed by the 322nd Armored Task Force, was to attack Rach Bap and Base 82. Meanwhile, the 318th Task Force would cross the An Dien Bridge, pass through An Dien, and proceed to Base 82. Three Ranger battalions attacking south out of Lai Khê were to strike Base 82 from the north. None of this worked as planned. The 43rd Infantry became stalled after advancing only 4 or 5 km north. Then, the tracked vehicles of the 322nd Task Force found the going extremely slow in the dense brush and cratered terrain. General Thuần, concerned that this armored force might become bogged down and have a bridge blown behind it ordered its withdrawal. He discovered, meanwhile, that the An Dien bridge had been seriously weakened by PAVN artillery (including AT-3 missiles) and would not support the tanks of the 318th Task Force. Under PAVN observation and sporadic heavy mortar and artillery fire, ARVN combat engineers attempted to repair the bridge. Casualties mounted, and the work progressed very slowly. About the same time, the 7th Ranger Group, with three battalions, moved southwest out of Lai Khê, crossed the Thi Thinh River and advanced on Base 82. The Rangers were immediately opposed in the thick jungle and rubber plantation by entrenched PAVN 9th Division troops, and their attack stalled well short of the objective.\n\nParagraph 9: From the initial founding of Funchal, the island of Madeira was peppered with small settlements along the coasts near access to the sea. The settlement that would later take on the name of Santa Maria Maior developed spontaneously from the first homes constructed in 1425. This agglomeration extended from Ribeira do João Gomes until Corpo Santo, along the beachfront, and concentrated around a small temple constructed to the invocation of Santa Maria, or Santa Maria do Calhau as it was briefly known. Santa Maria do Calhau, constructed in 1430, served the congregations east of the bay of Funchal, and was also known as Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Baixo (), or simply Santa Maria Maior. The chapel was the seat of the parish of Santa Maria Maior until 1508, when the Church of the Sé Catedral was completed, and the parishioners were obligated to transfer there for services. Santa Maria Maior was the first parish to be instituted in Funchal. Its name was given, as some historians believe, because it was constructed in larger proportions than the chapel consecrated in the name of Nossa Senhora da Conceição ordered built by João Gonçalves Zarco (on the present site of the Church of Santa Clara).  Zarco's chapel was known as Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Cima (meaning, geographically, top for its location), in opposition to Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Baixo (which means \"bottom\"), but referred to as Nossa Senhora do Calhau, because it was built on the coast (calhau is Portuguese for rock-covered beaches, typical of the Azores and Madeira).\n\nParagraph 10: Ordered to Cincinnati, Ohio, then to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, February 16.

The plays initially focused on the events surrounding Easter, but later expanded to include scenes from the Old Testament and the life of Mary Magdalene.

Salmon applies this theory to solve various philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle, and Quine's puzzle. Salmon's theory suggests that beliefs can differ depending on the proposition-guise used to express them. The example of Ralph believing Ortcutt to be a spy illustrates this concept. Overall, Salmon's theory emphasizes the importance of cognitive disposition and proposition-guise in understanding beliefs and semantic content."], "answers": ["Paragraph 4", "Paragraph 5", "Paragraph 1"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Salmon is a proponent of the theory of direct reference. Salmon has provided accounts both of propositional attitudes and of Frege's puzzle about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form \"a = b\". Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of semantic content. Thus, on his view the sentence \"Samuel Clemens was witty\" expresses exactly the same content as \"Mark Twain was witty\", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that Mark Twain was witty ipso facto believes that Samuel Clemens was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some proposition-guise or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called de dicto belief, and W. V. O. Quine's puzzle about de re belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.\n\nParagraph 2: MIBR started off group B by thrashing its compatriots in Sharks Esports as Leonardo \"leo_drunky\" Oliveira went the whole map without getting a kill; although he did get two kills, he killed one of his teammates and killed himself to set his kill total back to zero. NRG and North had an extremely close game, but NRG managed to come out in the end after winning four of the last five rounds. Ghost could not keep up its superb EPL season against mousesports as the majority-Canadian team could not get much done on either side of the map. Natus Vincere (Na'Vi) and ORDER played in a sloppy game, but Na'Vi came back from a 10–5 deficit and then again at 14–13 to barely scrape past the Australians to move on in the winner's bracket. Sharks pulled off a massive upset over North, and the win was not a close one as Sharks completely dominated the Danes. In the other lower bracket game, Ghost easily took down ORDER in the first map, but was forced to come back from an 8–13 deficit in the second map as Ghost eliminated the Australians. MIBR and NRG dominated each other's picks, but MIBR came back from a 5–10 deficit and then a 12-15 disadvantage to go on and win in overtime to secure a playoffs spot. Na'Vi was able to win its initial match when, in the past, the win eluded them, but the CIS team was smashed by mousesports as mousesports cruised its way to a playoff berth. Na'Vi easily defeated Sharks in two maps to send South America's representative home. Ghost and NRG had a very close series. NRG barely defeated Ghost in the first map and Ghost had only a slightly easier time in the second map. In the third map, NRG had a comfortable 11-4 halftime lead, but its performance against MIBR nearly replicated itself as Ghost came all the way back to win the game 16–14, thanks in part to Yassine \"Subroza\" Taoufik's 26 kills. In the final winner's match, MIBR barely defeated mousesports, but then easily took the second map to win the group. In the lower bracket side, Ghost surprisingly took the first map against Na'Vi. In the second map, Na'Vi had a 15–11 lead, but Ghost came back to tie the game; however, Na'Vi was able to win the game in overtime. Na'Vi carried that momentum and took advantage of Ghost's inexperience to easily take the third map and take the final playoff spot.\n\nParagraph 3: Tillman went to John Marshall High School in Milwaukee and he took Mass Communications Magnet Classes. As a teenager, Tillman made amateur videos and created Splice of Life, which was a program for a local Public-access television. After high school, Tillman attended Columbia College in Chicago and majored in Film and Video. Tillman decided to move to Chicago because he thought a lot was happening there creatively. \"There is a lot of theater there, and there are a lot of things happening in Chicago that I wanted to be a part of, so that's where I went to film school,\" according to Tillman. While in film school, he created a 30-minute short, Paula, which was a story of a 17-year-old, single African American mother who works in a diner and motivates the people around her. Paulas success attributed to numerous awards including the Black Filmmaker's Hall of Fame Award \"George Tillman Jr.\". and winning the Midwest Regional, Dramatic Category, of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' 19th Annual Student Academy Award competition (1992). In 1991, Tillman graduated from Columbia College and became a part of a directing and producing partnership with his fellow college, Robert Teitel, and together made their company, Menagerie Films. During that time, Tillman supported himself by being a production assistant. He helped work on various commercials, but he always knew he wanted to direct. \"Usually, I was the first guy on the set and the last guy to leave—eighteen hours of hard work. And I just felt like if I want to direct, why am I doing this?\" Tillman's only experience of being close to a director was made was when he worked on the film, Mo' Money. The writer of Mo' Money, Damon Wayans told the union that he wanted more African Americans to be a part of the crew, which is the major reason why Tillman got hired. Tillman was a set dresser and was able to see how they made the film. At that point, Tillman realized that if he wanted to direct he had to write his own script to make everything happen. \"It was going to be a long road from being a PA (production's assistant) to a director.\"\n\nParagraph 4: As of 2019, tarkhuna is produced in Georgia under \"Natakhtari\" and \"Zedazeni\" brands; in Lithuania under \"Selita Klasika\" as \"Tarchunas\"; and in Russia, where one of the producers is OAO Narzan under the brand \"Ледяная Жемчужина\" as \"Тархун\". The drink became available on the general USSR market for the first time in 1981. The pilot batch was sold on the territory of the Main Botanical Garden of the USSR Academy of Sciences in standard 0.33 liter bottles. Subsequently, its recipe was transferred to food industry enterprises, and, since 1983, \"Tarhun\" began to be sold in many republics of the USSR and administrative regions of the RSFSR in bottles of 0.33 and 0.5 liters.\n\nParagraph 5: The Easter Plays represented in their day the highest development of the secular drama; nevertheless this most important event in the life of Jesus did not suffice: the people wished to see his whole life, particularly the story of the Passion. Thus a series of dramas originated, which were called Passion Plays, the sufferings of Jesus being their principal subject. Some of them end with the entombment of Christ; in others the Easter Play was added, in order to show the Saviour in His glory; others again close with the Ascension or with the dispersion of the Apostles. But, since the persecution of the Saviour is intelligible only in the light of His work as teacher, this part of the life of Christ was also added, while some authors of these plays went back to the Old Testament for symbolical scenes, which they added to the Passion Plays as \"prefigurations\"; or the plays begin with the Creation, the sin of Adam and Eve, and the fall of the Angels. Again two short dramas were inserted: the Lament of Mary and the Mary Magdalene Play. The sequence \"Planctus ante nescia\", which was brought to Germany from France during the latter half of the 12th century, is the basis for the Lamentations of Mary. This sequence is merely a monologue of Mary at the foot of the Cross; by the introduction of John, the Saviour, and the bystanders as taking part in the lamentations, a dramatic scene was developed which became a part of almost all Passion Plays and has been retained even in their latest survivor. The Magdalene Play represents the seduction of Mary Magdalene by the devil and her sinful life up to her conversion. In Magdalene's sinfulness the people saw a picture of the depraved condition of mankind after the sin of the Garden of Eden, from which it could be redeemed only through the sacrifice of Christ. This profound thought, which could not be effaced even by the coarse reproduction of Magdalene's life, explains the presence of this little drama in the Passion Play.\n\nParagraph 6: The temples shows influences from Bengal architecture which at that time had absorbed British influences in colonial India. The temples also seem to be influenced by the Deulas of Orissa, later assimilated into Bengali architecture. The temple dome shows Buddhist influences in its profile, as originally North Indian Hindu temples had a Shikhara shaped like a mountain peak to signify the divine Meru. Domes like this one were also used on Buddhist Stupa prevalent in India since the time of emperor Ashoka, or around the third century BCE. However they were inaccessible mounds and it is with the arrival of Persian architecture through the Khalji dynasty that true free standing domes at major scales developed in India. They were later further developed by the Mughals. As such, the dome of the temple has Persian influences as at the time it was built the architecture had already been well syncretised and had become common in Indian architecture. The main temple, the Vishnu temple, the Devi temple and the Nataraja temple all have domes. As well, domes are a common feature in the old Hindu temples of Mauritius. The main temple is a variation of the panchayatna temple whereby a central shrine is dedicated to the main deity with 4 subsidiary deities in each corner. The early panchayatna temples had 5 separate entities with the central shrine being most prominent. Here the style happens on a single building, the principal deity is towered by the main dome and an ornate amalaka stylised with floral designs topped with the kalash and trishul. The four subsidiary spires rise from the four corners and have images of deities like Brahma and Kartikeya. This style of temple is also known as the Pancharatna style temple in West Bengal whereby the style is named by the number of pinnacles or ratnas the temples have. If it has one ratna, it's called Ekratna and it can go up till nine in which case it's called Navratna as the Dakshineshwar Kali temple is known. The veranda attached to the main temple resembles the thakur-dalan, which is common in the old houses of Calcutta, probably an influence from the British as it's a common feature in the zamindar mansions. The thakur-dalan is a veranda where the deity of Durga is invoked during the Durga Puja in West Bengal, Orissa and parts of Bihar. This also seems to be the case for the Vishnu temple on the right. The main temple is decorated with images of various Hindu deities and floral designs. Since its construction, the temple is always painted white while the sculptures and the floral designs are colorful, in contrast to the white background. The central part of the main temple is dedicated to lord Shiva in the form of the shiv ling and the four corners his wife, goddess Parvati, their sons; lord Ganesha and lord Kartikeya and another form of Shiva; lord Bhairava. Facing the shiv ling is Nandi, the gate-keeper.\n\nParagraph 7: Expert Sue Cubitt of the auction house had the works examined. The Chagall certificate had a misprint and she became suspicious. Jan Nieuwenhuizen Segaar, a representative of Karel Appel, contacted the artist who said that work was his but Cubitt was still suspicious.  The Chagall committee in Paris verified that the certificate was a forgery and therefore the drawing was also a forgery.  A similar thing happened with the Asger Jorn certificate. The auction house decided to withdraw all the works from sale because it could not guarantee their authenticity. Sue Cubitt decided to inform Ernst Schöller of the Stuttgart Fine Art and Antiquities squad.\n\nParagraph 8: O’Dunne's career as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore was filled with many ups and downs. There were times in his career that he felt as though he was being ‘muzzled’, and was never permitted to fully express his opinions. During his time spent as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore he was considered a fearless and fair leader in the judicial system. He was both respected and feared by the citizens of Baltimore and the members of the legal community alike. During his forty-five years as a judge he helped clean up many aspects of the legal system including, but not limited to; fixing the penal establishment, abolishing the ancient Black Hand of the Justices of the Peace, reorganizing the state's legal business, and attacking on the old fee system. His most well-known court decision was made in the case of The University of Maryland v. Donald G. Murray, where he ruled in the favor of Donald G. Murray and started the movement that ended the discrimination against African-Americans applying to law schools in Maryland. He also was responsible for the desegregation of golf courses in the city of Baltimore; as long as the member dues were paid color was not to be a factor of who was allowed.  He was known for his harsh sentences on minor criminal offences, such as robbery, but was not as harsh on those individuals that back talked and police, later being accused of disturbing the peace. He constantly fought corrupt members of the police department, lazy judges, and the press just to name a few. O'Dunne's main goal was to keep the streets safe and free of any criminal behavior regardless of its degree of offence, but would become highly irritated with those police officers that tried to wrongfully accuse a man of a crime. After his retirement in 1945 at the age of seventy, he still continued to actively follow the legal issues of the city. One noted incident he took great interest in was the escape of Maryland State Penitentiary inmate, Joseph Holmes. When he received word that Holmes had escaped most would have expected him to believe along the lines that, \"justice must prevail\", since he had spent many years as a Supreme Bench justice with that mentality.  Instead he shocked the public with a quote from Shakespeare's Othello, \"I do perceive here a divided duty…\" and continued to look at the prisoners escape as not a bad, but a good thing. Eugene O'Dunne spent twenty years of his life as a judge for the city of Baltimore in hopes of ridding the city of crime. During that time he made many friends and just as many enemies, but those who were a part of the legal system during O’Dunne's years as a judge for the city of the Baltimore would all agree he was most certainly the most memorable judge of his time.\n\nParagraph 9: Before the start of the 2021 season, Phillips relinquished her role as co-captain with Randall, setting up Randall to be appointed sole captain of the team. The league was restructured back to a single ladder in which the top six teams made the finals and the top two teams received byes into the preliminary finals. Adelaide entered the last round third on the ladder behind Brisbane and Collingwood. Although they were never in the top two because of losses to Fremantle and Melbourne, they were able to finish on top of the ladder by defeating Collingwood after Brisbane's loss earlier in the round. Phillips played better in the first half of the season, being named best on ground twice, first in Round 1 against  and then in Round 4 against Brisbane. She also earned one vote in each of her team's next two games, including against  when Adelaide scored 85 points, the second-highest total in AFLW history at the time. She kicked at least one goal in the first six games of the season, highlighted by four of her team's six goals against Brisbane, tying her career high for goals in a game. In the second half of the season, Phillips struggled with an injury to her left knee that was first aggravated in Round 5 and not publicly disclosed until after the season ended. After Round 6, she did not receive any more votes. Although Phillips scored two goals in Adelaide's preliminary final win against Melbourne, she did not reach ten disposals in either of her finals games, despite tallying at least fourteen in all of her home-and-away games. Adelaide lost the 2021 AFLW Grand Final to Brisbane. Phillips had minor surgery on her left knee a week later. Overall, she was named to her third All-Australian team and finished the season as Adelaide's leading goalkicker for the second time.\n\nParagraph 10: Kentish plovers either nest solitarily or in a loose semicolonial manner. They are ground-nesting birds that lay their eggs in small shallow scrapes prepared by the male during courtship on the bare ground. Selection of the breeding ground is essential for the survival of nests and broods; nests are placed near the water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation; often on slightly elevated sites in order to have a good view of the surroundings to spot predators from a distance or near small bushes, plants or grass clusters, where the eggs are partly sheltered from predators. Nests are filled with nest material i.e. pebble stones, small parts of shells, fish bones, small twigs, grass and other debris. The modal clutch size comprises three eggs, although some nests are already completed with one or two eggs. In fresh or incomplete nests, the eggs tend to be fully exposed, but as the incubation period progresses, the amount of nest material increases and the eggs become practically completely covered. During the incubation period, the Kentish plover recesses for variable periods of time mainly to forage or to perform other activities essential for self-maintenance. To compensate for the resulting lack of presence and increased predation risk, they use nest materials to cover and hence camouflage the eggs and keep them insulated. Kentish plovers regulate the amount of nest material actively. This was shown experimentally in a study by increasing or decreasing the amount of nest material artificially. Within 24hrs, the plovers had restored the amount of nest material back to original. This is of advantage because nest materials help a good insulation of eggs, therefore preventing egg temperature fluctuations )  (hence avoiding embryo hypothermia) and reducing the energetic costs of incubation for the parents. By regulating the amount of nest material, the Kentish plovers balances the advantages i.e. insulation and anti-predator defence and the disadvantages of nest material i.e. overheating. Incubation is the process by which the eggs are kept at optimal temperature i.e. between 37 °C and 38 °C for the embryonic development of birds with most of the heat deriving from the incubating bird. Kentish plover eggs are incubated for 20–25 days by both sexes; females mostly incubate during the day whilst males incubate during the night. Female Kentish plovers usually lose mass during the day, which is unexpected since they get relieved by the males for a variable amount of time. The loss would be much higher if the females were to incubate alone. This loss is a cost of incubation due to the depletion of fat stores and the evaporation of water."}

He finished high school in 1949 and in 1950 debuted as a political hack-writer on Przekrój. In 1952 he moved into the government-run Writer's House (ZLP headquarters with the restricted canteen). In 1953, during the Stalinist terror in postwar Poland, Mrożek was one of several signatories of an open letter from ZLP to Polish authorities supporting the persecution of Polish religious leaders imprisoned by the Ministry of Public Security. He participated in the defamation of Catholic priests from Kraków, three of whom were condemned to death by the Communist government in February 1953 after being groundlessly accused of treason (see the Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia). Their death sentences were not enforced, although Father Józef Fudali died in unexplained circumstances while in prison. Mrożek wrote a full-page article for the leading newspaper in support of the verdict, entitled \"Zbrodnia główna i inne\" (The Capital Crime and Others), comparing death-row priests to degenerate SS-men and Ku-Klux-Klan killers. He married Maria Obremba living in Katowice and relocated to Warsaw in 1959. In 1963 Mrożek travelled to Italy with his wife and decided to defect together. After five years in Italy, he moved to France and in 1978 received French citizenship.\n\nParagraph 4: In December 1856, Snowden wrote to Missouri Representative John S. Phelps, hoping for progress with the legislation, and stating that he was already \"pressed on all hands, and from every quarter, for the new cent—in fact, the public are very anxious for its issue\". When the legislation, amended to include the weight and alloy the Mint had decided on, was debated in the House of Representatives on December 24, it was opposed by Tennessee Congressman George Washington Jones over the legal tender provision; Jones felt that under the Constitution's Contract Clause, only gold and silver should be made legal tender. Phelps defended the bill on the ground that Congress had the constitutional power to regulate the value of money, but when the bill was brought back up to be considered on January 14, 1857, the legal tender provision had been removed. This time, the bill was opposed by New York Congressman Thomas R. Whitney, who objected to a provision in the bill that legalized the Mint's practice of designing and striking medals commissioned by the public, feeling that the government should not compete with private medallists. The provision was removed, and the bill passed the following day. The House version was then considered by the Senate, which debated it on February 4, and passed it with a further amendment allowing the redemption of the Spanish coins for a minimum of two years. The House agreed to this on February 18, and President Pierce signed the bill on the 21st. The act made foreign gold and silver coins no longer legal tender, but Spanish dollars were redeemable at their nominal value for two years in exchange for the new copper-nickel cents. The half cent was abolished. The new pieces would be the same size (19 mm), though somewhat heavier, than cents are today.\n\nParagraph 5: Annie Devine wasn't very interested in the Civil Rights Movement until Dave Dennis, George Raymond (NAACP) and some others started using C.O. Chinn's motel to hold NAACP meetings. She would pass by their meetings on her way home some nights, and one night she decided to join in after they moved the meetings to a church away from the city center. Annie became interested in Civil Rights after a quick encounter with a cop at that specific meeting. That very next day, Devine started canvassing for votes on the streets of Mississippi; she began meeting with other blacks in Canton to discuss civil rights issues. Eventually, Devine quit her job selling insurance to work full-time for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Quickly realizing that canvassing and asking for votes wasn't making a huge dent in the movement, Annie wanted to be a part of the bigger phase two. In 1964, Devine joined Fannie Lou Hamer and Victoria Gray Adams to become the first black women to speak before the United States House of Representatives. The three were elected state representatives for the progressive Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Devine helped found the party, and was a member of its delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey.  Upon returning from the convention, Annie decided to accept running for congresswoman of her district. She was declined by the secretary of state to have her name on the ballot. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) was also denied to run individually in the election even though they had the right number of qualified electors. Annie was then elected by freedom votes. She makes sure to state in her interview, “... very strong feeling there had to be some political force other than civil rights organizations in this state to bring about change” (Devine). Annie also had a very strong opinion about the Voting Rights bill passed by president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. She said, “there’s nothing in the voting bill that can really protect you. You can get registered, the federal registrar will register you, there’s some clause in there that says the FBI can see to it that you’re protected when you go down to vote, but before voting day and after voting day there’s no protection provided.. And that’s where the trouble comes in” (Devine). Mrs. Devine was set on the bigger picture of having full rights and not bits and pieces of equality.\n\nParagraph 6: Features:Our Town (1940) - Best Man at Wedding (uncredited) (film debut)The Mortal Storm (1940) - Student in Second Classroom Scene (uncredited)The Howards of Virginia (1940) - James Howard at 16Northern Pursuit (1943) - Heinzmann (uncredited)Two Girls and a Sailor (1944) - Frank MillerThe White Cliffs of Dover (1944) - Dying American Soldier (uncredited)Maisie Goes to Reno (1944) - Sgt.

The need for individual titration would be most important with this compound.\" 2C-P is one of the most potent compounds in the 2C family of psychedelics, rivaled only by 2C-TFM.\n\nParagraph 8: Marketed with the tagline \"For men who should know better\", Loaded was launched in May 1994. It was originally published by IPC Media who committed to its initial development following a discussion between the company's executives and James Brown during a job interview for the editorship of New Musical Express, also part of the IPC group. In development for a year, Loaded was predicted to be a flop, but IPC considered it a low-risk investment because the advertising department of its Music & Sport division already existed and the promotional budget was minimal. IPC itself had little faith in the magazine; according to Brown the staff were initially only contracted for 3 months after the launch. Taking its title from the Primal Scream song of the same name, the magazine was founded by Mick Bunnage, Tim Southwell and Brown.\n\nParagraph 9: Criticisms still persist, such as 1UP.com which, in an article discussing the \"lamest Pokémon\" of the series, referred to it as the \"infamous blackface Pokémon\". Washington Post writer Mary C. Morton described Jynx as having \"explicitly, albeit grossly caricatured, womanly features\", and challenged the assertion that the games crossed gender barriers with such. In their podcast, Retronauts, they emphasized it further, noting the design as \"creepy\" and that it maintained the issue of racism still. IGN also criticized the design, characterizing Jynx as a \"transvestite midget in racially offensive makeup\". GameDaily ranked it first on their list of the \"Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon\", noting its design suggested the presence of breasts, and echoing qualms regarding its resemblance to blackface performers. Games.net ranked it fourth on their \"Top 10 Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters\" list, questioning why the character was clothed in what resembled a \"slinky dress and push-up bra\". In the book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific, David Surman defended Jynx's design, suggesting that Sugimori developed it—along with Mr. Mime—to draw upon the humor of heta-uma (a term meaning bad/nice). The book notes that the designs \"oscillate between the poles of good and bad,\" and as a result offer diversity within the game and invite scrutiny from players. Jim Sterling of Destructoid included it in their list of 30 \"rubbish\" Pokémon, and stated \"Don’t act like you didn’t know it was f*cking coming.\" GamesRadar described Magmar and Jynx as the Romeo and Juliet of Pokémon. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson compared Jynx to the Gothita line due to both's designs being based on an \"overtly feminine form\", though describing Gothita's line as \"way less creepy\". Author Loredana Lipperini described Jynx as an \"opera singer\". Russ Frushtick of Polygon claimed that Jynx is a worst first-gen Pokémon that should be wiped from existence, and further stated that Jynx is just problematic at every turn. Liz Finnegan of The Escapist listed Jynx as worst Pokemon design, and further stated that the problem with Jynx is that she’s not menacing, nor is she cute. Jynx is just plain old ugly. VentureBeat placed Jynx on a list of \"seriously ugly Pokémon\" from the past twenty years, and claimed that Jynx has always weirded him out. Ben Skipper of International Business Times ranked Jynx as one of the very worst Pokemon designs. Sam Loveidge of Digital Spy listed Jynx as worst Pokémon design ever, and further stated that it got some seriously racist connotations and manages to look just human enough to be totally creepy-looking. Elijah Watson of Complex described Jynx as the best Pokemon, but stated that it is also one of the strangest-looking Pokemon out there, but it can handle its own better than we may think. Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku described Jynx as a literal blackface of Pokemon. In 2016, a Japanese poll voted which Pokémon is the ugliest with Jynx receiving 37 votes and fourth most voted. David Lozada of GameRevolution listed Jynx as the weirdest Pokémon ever, stating that Jynx is the embodiment of weird.\n\nParagraph 10: Pitchfork contributor Jason Heller said \"Wraithlike vocals and numbed melodies hanging over pinprick prog fretwork... The pulse of ethereal '70s rock – from Pink Floyd to Hawkwind's more celestial moments... Dual vocal lines emanate from some unseen place, sometimes braided together in a conjoined plea for connection... Heartbreakingly beautiful.\" Kim Kelly of Noisey music by Vice said \"Landless is a tour-de-force... out-there progression, ethereal atmosphere, and unexpected harmonies.\" Natalie Zina Walschots of Exclaim writes \"Eight Bells have created a veritable monument to yearning... Breathless, imbalanced genius.\" BrooklynVegan staffer Rob Sperry-Fromm says \"There's a classical doom feel... wedded to a modern sense of progressiveness, with reverb-y harmonies and organ melding creating a vivid contrast with the driving, powerful drumming of new member Rae Amitay.\" According to the Invisible Oranges staff, \"[Melynda] Jackson's chiming and piercing guitar tone evokes The Edge's celebratory playing style. She and [Haley] Westeiner employ two-part harmonies, the sort often used in medieval choir music... Their jagged, sometimes Slint-like approach to songwriting, and their assonant sining make their songs obscure... I find myself obsessed with the surface of Eight Bells' music, curious what lies beneath.\" MetalSucks Senior Editor Anso DF says \"Another time and dimension... where Ulver and Ihsahn are Pink Floyd's precedents, where lyrics can trade mind-travels for centuries-ago suffering...\" Walker MacMurdo at the Willamette Week writes, \"Soaring, clean vocals punching through an aura of swirling melancholy... Landless sounds like a strong contender – Portland or otherwise – for the best metal album of the usually slow first quarter of 2016.\" According to loudwire.com, Landless is ”An exercise in sonic dreamscapes... Unpredictable from moment to moment, Landless is an exciting listen.\" Allen Griffin at Burning Ambulance says ”Like any great trio, each instrument is equally important to the overall architecture of the sound... Eight Bells is much more than the sum of their parts. Eight Bells have crafted a unique sound, one that is thematically consistent, from lyrics to artwork and sonic palette as well.\" According to Echoes and Dust writer Peter Meinertzhagen, \"Landless drifts like an ethereal mist, enveloping you slowly... Eight Bells shrug off the meandering bluesy psychedelia of their debut in favor of a sound that is darker, more mature, and more atmospheric, sounding less like a jam and more like a crafted narrative.\" Manny-O-War at Nine Circles says \"It takes special talent and songwriting to grab the listener with what's not there; to entice the listener with merely the mood or emotion of your music. Eight Bells are experts here... The perfect combination of Brian Eno, Ulver and King Crimson.\" Brian Krasman of Meat Mead Metal writes \"From the progressive sections, to the enthralling arrangements, to the lush vocal harmonies that push the story, to the propulsive drumming, this group create weaving, winding tapestries that are melodic, dark, hypnotic... This is an adventure.\""}

Frightmare received his shot at the Cup on June 26, but was defeated when the champion, BDK member Tim Donst, choked him out with a necktie. On August 27 Frightmare entered the eighth annual Young Lions Cup tournament, defeating Brendan Michael Thomas, who had eliminated him from the tournament the previous year, in his first round match. Later that same night he defeated Christian Abel, Kaio, Amasis, Johnny Gargano and Akira Tozawa in a six-way elimination match to advance to the finals of the tournament. On August 29 Frightmare defeated BDK member Lince Dorado to win the eighth Young Lions Cup tournament and score Chikara's first major victory in its war against BDK. Frightmare made his first successful defense of the Young Lions Cup on September 19, defeating BDK's Pinkie Sanchez. On October 23 Frightmare successfully defended the Young Lions Cup against Johnny Gargano, who cashed in his \"Golden Opportunity\" to get a title match. The following week Frightmare made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. On December 12, 2010, at the season nine finale, Reality is Relative, Incoherence aligned themselves with Hallowicked's long–time rival UltraMantis Black by saving him from Sinn Bodhi and The Batiri. On March 13, 2011, Frightmare broke Max Boyer's record from 2006 for most successful defenses of the Young Lions Cup, when he defeated Batiri member Obariyon to make his sixth successful defense. On April 15, Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black, now known collectively as the Spectral Envoy, were eliminated from the 2011 King of Trios in the first round by Team Dragon Gate (Akira Tozawa, Kagetora and Super Shisa). On June 26, Frightmare defeated Batiri member Kodama to make his seventh and final Young Lions Cup defense. On August 27, he was stripped of the title in time for the ninth annual Young Lions Cup tournament. The Spectral Envoy and the Dark Army (Sinn Bodhi, Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon) faced each other in an eight-man tag team match on September 18, when the former was joined by UltraMantis Black's former Order of the Neo-Solar Temple partner Crossbones. The Spectral Envoy managed to win the match, after Ultramantis pinned Bodhi. Afterwards, Frightmare was sidelined for the next eight months with an injury, before returning on May 20, 2012, during Chikara's tenth anniversary weekend. On September 14, Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black entered the 2012 King of Trios, defeating Mihara, The Mysterious and Handsome Stranger and Tito Santana in their first round match. The following day, the Spectral Envoy advanced to the semifinals of the tournament, after defeating their rival team The Batiri. However, following the match, the Spectral Envoy was attacked by members of The Batiri and Ophidian. On the third and final day of the tournament, the Spectral Envoy first defeated F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano) in the semifinals and then Team ROH (Mike Bennett, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) in the finals, despite interference from The Batiri, Delirious and Ophidian, to win the 2012 King of Trios.

Caroline Weir had opened the scoring in the 8th minute and although Everton had equalised through Grace Clinton within a couple of minutes, Khadija Shaw had put City ahead before the halftime break. As Everton pressed forward in the second half in search of way back into the game, City capitalised as Lauren Hemp doubled City's leading before substitute Jess Park added a fourth and Ellen White saw her header fumbled into the goal by goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan in the final minute. The match was Willie Kirk's last game as Everton manager as he was sacked three days later. City once again struck early to open the scoring against Durham, this time through summer signing Filippa Angeldal in the 16th minute. The Championship side surrendered much of the possession to City who were denied a second goal with both Janine Beckie and Angeldal hitting the frame of the goal. Substitute Weir, on her 100th appearance for the club, finally managed to give City the cushion they were pushing for in the 87th minute, firing into the roof of the net from the edge of the Durham box. Beckie also got on the scoresheet in stoppage time as City ran out 3–0 winners. Having played out a thrilling 2–2 draw in the league the previous month, City traveled to Manchester United for the third group game. City's fast starts continue as Hayley Raso latched on to an early turnover, rolling the ball to Vicky Losada who fired the ball past Sophie Baggaley from the edge of the box with fewer than two minutes played. Despite controlling most of the opening exchanges, United managed to level on the half hour mark when goalkeeper Karima Benameur Taieb spilled the ball against her own body under pressure from Kirsty Hanson who knocked it back to Ivana Fuso to fire home from ten yards. With chances few and far between in a tighter second half, United broke the deadlock eight minutes from time when Ona Batlle broke down the wing to feed the ball to Alessia Russo in the box. The forward's shot was parried by Taieb and fell to Demi Stokes who was pickpocketed by Batlle before the Spaniard calmly stroked the ball into the net, sealing a 2–1 derby defeat for City. The final group game against Leicester City scheduled for 15 December 2021 was delayed due to a COVID-19 outbreak in the Manchester City squad. With all other games played, a victory over Everton had put United top of the group on nine points. City were three points behind with the delayed game still to play, although United were assured of a place in the knockout stage either as a group winner or as the best-placed runner up. City knew a win would send them top on goal difference while a win on penalties would send them through as the best second-placed team. However, opponents Leicester were also still alive as they could progress as runner-up if they won outright while a penalty shootout win for Leicester would see both teams miss out and instead send Group C runners-up Charlton Athletic through. The game was eventually played on 12 January 2022. Sitting bottom of the WSL, newly promoted Leicester had made a change of manager the previous month, bringing in Lydia Bedford who had guided the team to their first win of the season in the final game before the winter break. Despite the uptick in form, City blew a youthful Leicester side away as Bedford handed out five debuts including four academy players. For the third time in four group games, City led inside 10 minutes as Jess Park delivered a perfect cross for White to tap in. Hemp and Georgia Stanway both netted braces as City ran riot to punch their ticket to the knockout stage as group winner with a 5–0 win as teenage goalkeeper Khiara Keating kept a cleansheet on her senior debut.\n\nParagraph 4: Rabanus Maurus: \"Or; The ruler of the synagogue signifies Moses; he is named Jairus, ‘illuminating,’ or, ‘that shall illuminate,’ because he received the words of life to give to us, and by them enlightens all, being himself enlightened by the Holy Spirit. The daughter of the ruler, that is, the synagogue itself, being as it were in the twelfth year of its age, that is, in the season of puberty, when it should have borne spiritual progeny to God, fell into the sickness of error. While then the Word of God is hastening to this ruler's daughter to make whole the sons of Israel, a holy Church is gathered from among the Gentiles, which while it was perishing by inward corruption, received by faith that healing that was prepared for others. It should be noted, that the ruler's daughter was twelve years old, and this woman had been twelve years afflicted; thus she had begun to be diseased at the very time the other was born; so in one and the same age the synagogue had its birth among the Patriarchs, and the nations without began to be polluted with the pest of idolatry. For the issue of blood may be taken in two ways, either for the pollution of idolatry, or for obedience to the pleasures of flesh and blood. Thus as long as the synagogue flourished, the Church languished; the falling away of the first was made the salvation of the Gentiles. Also the Church draws nigh and touches the Lord, when it approaches Him in faith. She believed, spake her belief, and touched, for by these three things, faith, word, and deed, all salvation is gained. She came behind Him, as He spake, If any one serve me, let him follow me; (John 12:26.) or because, not having seen the Lord present in the flesh, when the sacraments of His incarnation were fulfilled, she came at length to the grace of the knowledge of Him. Thus also she touched the hem of His garment, because the Gentiles, though they had not seen Christ in the flesh, received the tidings of His incarnation. The garment of Christ is put for the mystery of His incarnation, wherewith His Deity is clothed; the hem of His garment are the words that hang upon His incarnation. She touches not the garment, but the hem thereof; because she saw not the Lord in the flesh, but received the word of the incarnation through the Apostles. Blessed is he that touches but the uttermost part of the word by faith. She is healed while the Lord is not in the city, but while He is yet on the way; as the Apostles cried, Because ye judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. (Acts 13:46.) And from the time of the Lord's coming the Gentiles began to be healed.\"\n\nParagraph 5: In addition to teaching, research, and writing, Smart was something of an activist in promoting improved cross-cultural understanding.  In the 1970s, he was involved in several initiatives in Britain to broaden the public religious education curriculum, previously purely Christian, to include the range of world religions.  He also served on the National Schools Council advising on broadening the religious education curriculum. The teaching of religion in the state school system in the United Kingdom, which is mandatory, distinguishes teaching about religion from faith-nurture, which is not properly part of the task.  Smart was involved in the Assembly of the World's Religions series of meetings (1985, 1990, 1992) sponsored by Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification movement and served as president of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. In 1999, he was co-convener of the First Assembly of the Inter-religious and International Federation for World Peace, established by Moon. Smart reiterated his conviction that without improved understanding of the religious and cultural Other, peace in the world would remain elusive. His concept of religions as worldviews, and his value-free approach to religious studies – that is, refraining from elevating a single understanding of \"truth\" as some sort of evaluative criterion of religious authenticity-opened up for him the study of non-religious ideologies or worldviews (he preferred this term because it does not imply that theism is an essential element) as well as of new religious movements, which he saw as one result of globalisation.  He also wrote the foreword for the Unification publication, World Scripture, edited by Andrew Wilson, in which he stated that, \"it is obvious that as we move toward a world civilization, in which so many cultures and spiritual traditions will impinge on one another, all of us should understand one another.\" Smart was also a member of the International Board of the Global Ethics and Religion Forum, an educational, non-profit NGO dedicated to increasing global ethical responsibility.\n\nParagraph 6: Three women fight against rules; Claire's struggle with alcohol and her fragile consistency, Bridget's courage (abused by Claire's fearsome husband once) being a prostitute and face the sexual harassment of the dirty and dominant Sheriff Jake and finally Maxine with her courage and strong character in several memorial scenes; for example: Threatening Jake with death if necessary in order to stop the cruel execution of her husband, do the same with \"The Kid\" when he tries to steal a coin and when finding the kidnapped widows by the corrupt \"Pinkerton\" cowboys, rescue a poor wounded Claire (whipped by John and tortured with thermal water by David), neutralize the blond cowboy John with one shot after giving him a chance to regret and force the other cowboy David to disrobe, strip and disappear and threaten to kill him if he doesn't what Mrs. Thornton says: Flee embarrassed totally naked into the desert and hiding amongst rocks in the night (who desperately meets the preacher and his group of Mexican partners; Roberto and Segundo, the next day and after making fun of him, is killed in cold blood by the Hangman in a single shoot). Claire recovers from her injuries and together the three women set off for Jerico again when they met \"The Kid\" who guides them to a cave and steals their expensive horse. These women find refuge in the tavern of a dear friend of Bridget's (Madame Dubois) until they are found by Jake who offers them a deal in search of the money. Claire escapes at dawn while Maxine and Bridget go looking for her, find her, and they are helped by \"The Stranger\" who turns out to be just another \"Thornton\" in search of fortune. The women finally face the powerful in a final battle in which slow characters do not survive in the hot desert climate, as Roberto, who is mortally wounded by The Preacher's men and his brother-in-law (Segundo) who is neutralized by Claire while trying to kidnap her and Bridget. Women face horrible enemies to defeat especially against rivals as dashing as the old preacher or hangman; so bloody and wicked as to enjoy the sorrows of others, betray, kill and humiliate one of the \"Pinkerton\" cowboys leaving his naked body (David) ready for coyotes in the desert afternoon, beat \"The Stranger\" in a ramshackle cabin being challenged, use the God's word at his convenience, publicly make fun of \"The Thornton\" and torture them, intimidate the widows, retain Maxine (who defends herself and confronts him with an iron weapon) neutralize with a lethal shot the banker Van Damn (who throughout history is seen suffering the loss of his beloved Greta and thirsty for revenge and money) after confessing that he buried Greta with the three \"Thornton\" 'Bandidos ' in a dirty cave, to be finally neutralized by the wild Bridget.\n\nParagraph 7: All four upper secondary schools are bilingual and about one fourth of the tuition is given in English by native speakers. This also means that course materials are both in Swedish and English. The schools have students attending from all over the greater Stockholm region, making admission highly competitive. VRG Odenplan has some of the highest minimum admission requirements in the country. Admission to its natural sciences program with natural sciences orientation is especially competitive; in 2009 all students had perfect grades, and since 2016 all students has had a score of at least 330.0 (with a national average of 228.7; out of maximum possible 340.0) translated from their grades from Swedish primary school, due to high application rates.\n\nParagraph 8: As a result of his frequent traveling, Abdullah the Butcher usually served as more of a special attraction than as a consistent championship contender. Accordingly, Abdullah never did win a world heavyweight championship, though he would capture several regional titles during his career. He won his first major championship on October 23, 1967, when he teamed with Dr. Jerry Graham to defeat John & Carlos Tolos for the NWA's Canadian Tag Team Titles in Vancouver. A few years later, he ventured to the Montreal region, where he had three reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion between 1969 and 1972, feuding against Ivan Koloff and Johnny Rougeau. He later served as one of the premier rule breakers in Calgary's Stampede territory, capturing the NWA Canadian Championship, as well as having six North American Heavyweight Title reigns during the early 1970s. On June 24, 1972, he defeated Ernie Ladd in Akron, Ohio, to capture his first of two NWF Heavyweight Championships. In 1972, he wrestled a few matches for World Wide Wrestling Federation. Also he worked for Stampede Wrestling from 1970 to 1974. During the mid-1970s, he frequently performed in Detroit, Michigan's Big-Time Wrestling territory, where he engaged in a rivalry against The Sheik. He teamed with Killer Tim Brooks to win the region's version of the NWA World Tag Team Titles before defeating Bobo Brazil on February 8, 1975, for the NWA United States Championship.\n\nParagraph 9: O'Bannon briefly trained for war in the Caribbean and sailed from Boston on 29 August 1942 for the Southwest Pacific, where the long and arduous Guadalcanal campaign had just begun. For over a year, the Navy—stretched thin to cover its worldwide commitments at a period when new ships were just beginning to join the fleet in any number—was to fight and fight again in the Solomon Islands in one of the most bitterly contested campaigns of history, wresting air and sea control from the Japanese and providing the Marine Corps and the Army with every possible support as they gained ground inch by inch on the myriad islands. Assigned the Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon 21), O'Bannon played a valiant part in these endeavors, winning a Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nParagraph 10: A year later she became a reporter for the paper's \"Style\" section. Williams' deft political profiles were an immediate success and eventually she branched out to Vanity Fair, covering everyone from Bill Clinton to Barbara Bush to Colin Powell as well as penning profiles of her own struggles and foibles. She was also a member of Slate book club, a group of writers who regularly paired off to conduct online dialogs about recently-published fiction and nonfiction, and contributed occasional book reviews to the Washington Monthly. In 2000 Williams became an op-ed columnist for the Post. A year and a half later, she was diagnosed with liver cancer; in spite of being told she only had a few months left, Williams lived for more than three years. Her final Post column, written in November 2004, focused on her young daughter's Halloween costume. In June 2011 the National Society of Newspaper Columnists named it one of the top 15 newspaper columns in American history."}

Phage therapy had not been licensed for clinical use in the United States or Western Europe, but Strathdee enlisted the help of an international team of physicians and researchers to save her husband's life. After the successful treatment, the case received widespread attention in medical journals and the press. Since then, Strathdee and her friend Robert Schooley have been actively involved in helping other patients receive phage therapy and have established the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH) at UCSD to assist patients with superbug infections. Their goal is to conduct research and clinical trials to determine the efficacy of phage therapy and enable its widespread use. The Patterson case has led to the treatment of numerous other patients with multidrug-resistant infections using phage therapy. The IPATH center is also involved in a NIH-funded trial of intravenous phage therapy.", "The Huaorani tribe attacked a group of foreigners known as the Palm Beach missionaries. In an effort to divide the group before attacking, three women from the Huaorani tribe were sent to the other side of the river. One woman remained hidden while the other two made themselves known. Two of the missionaries went into the water to greet them, but were ambushed by Nampa. One of the missionaries attempted to scare Nampa by firing a shot from his pistol, which mildly injured the hidden woman and grazed Nampa's attacker. There are conflicting accounts regarding the effect of the bullet, with some believing that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, and others suspecting that his death was a result of the wound. Rachel Saint, one of the missionaries, disagreed with this belief and argued that the eyewitnesses supported her perspective. However, there is a prevailing belief among the Huaorani tribe that Nampa died from the wound. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors attacked the remaining missionaries on the beach, spearing Saint and another missionary named McCully. A third missionary named Youderian attempted to reach the radio for help but was also speared in the process.

An improved version was introduced in 1940, designated First-Aid Packet, U.S. Government – Carlisle Model to tackle the problem of front line wounds and casualties. The Carlisle Bandage underwent a number of changes in its development during WW2. In summer of 1940, U.S. Army, Carlisle Model Small First-Aid Dressing made its appearance. It was contained in a waxed rectangular tuck-end carton, printed with the required markings. Considerable difficulty was encountered in the procurement of the first aid packet. During the Army expansion of 1940, approximately eight million were required for initial stock of equipment In the middle of 1941, the Medical Department decided to amend their specifications, and placed purchase orders for containers made out of tin (instead of brass). The new version was introduced by fall of 1941, together with the very first Sulfanilamide Shaker Envelopes. During the early part of 1943, a plastic container (called Tenite) was developed and put into production, but under field conditions the package warped and broke open. In the course of 1943 the items were wrapped in laminated paper, reinforced with aluminum or lead foil, and covered internally with either pliofilm, cellophane, or polyvinyl butyral and placed inside an appropriate waxed cardboard shell. The small Carlisle model first aid dressing measured approximately 4\"X2\"X1\". When opened, its 1/2\"-thick pad measured 7\"X4\" and had two long gauze tietapes. The Large Carlisle model first aid dressing measured approximately 11 3/4\"square. Brief instructions were stenciled on the bandage in red ink. Most packaging included the word \"Sterile\" and the directions \"Red color indicates back of dressing – put other side next to wound.\" If a dressing was \"camouflaged\" it was olive drab in color. Detailed explanations and photos concerning the application of dressing to wound were included in a printed manuals for US soldiers.\n\nParagraph 2: After the Bothy Band disbanded, Lunny became a session musician on various projects, including Davey and Morris, the first album to feature Shaun Davey. In 1981, Lunny reunited with Moore to form Moving Hearts, along with a young uilleann piper, Davy Spillane. Following the example of the group Horslips, Moving Hearts combined Irish traditional music with rock and roll, and also added elements of jazz to their sound. The group disbanded in 1985. In February 2007, Moving Hearts reunited for a concert in Dublin. In 2008 and 2009, the group performed again in several concerts in Ireland and the United States.\n\nParagraph 3: Patterson began patrol and escort in the approaches to Queenstown on 5 June. On 12 June, she dropped depth charges to help drive away a German U-boat attacking SS Indian. A collision with His Majesty's tug Dreadful at the entrance to Berehaven Harbour, Ireland, the night of 1 January 1918, damaged Patterson's bow but she resumed regular escort and patrol on 5 February. Two days later she rescued 12 survivors of steamship Mexico City, torpedoed by a German submarine. Patterson, patrolling in the Irish Sea on 17 May, dropped depth charges that drove away German .

Learning it, Zamindar's brother-in-law Bhaskar Rao (Rao Gopal Rao), a vicious person becomes jittery and arranges his men to slaughter the newborn child. To the fortune, the child is protected by a circus owner Chalapati Rao (Allu Ramalingaiah) and rears him. In the nick of time, Janaki Devi delivers the second child. Years rolled by, and the younger one Raja (N. T. Rama Rao) a good-hearted person exploited by Bhaskar Rao and submerged in all sorts of vices. Bhaskar Rao also plans to perform his daughter Jaya's (Jaya Prada) marriage with Raja to catch hold of the proprietary. Advocate Yugandhar (Prabhakar Reddy), the personal solicitor to Zamindar always suspects Bhaskar Rao and keeps an eye on him. Once Raja in a drunken state makes an accident in which a person dies, moving forward, he too hits and collapses when a woman, Ankamma (Sujatha) saves him, after recovery, he realizes that the person who died is Ankamma's father. Here he burns out of contrition and accepts his sin before Ankamma when she forgives him. There, he starts loving her which Zamindar opposes, so, he marries Ankamma in the temple. Bhaskar Rao becomes aware of it and makes an accident with Raja, by which he loses his memory. Parallelly, Bhaskar Rao misleads Zamindar by spreading the bereavement of Raja which Zamindar could not tolerate, and dies. After that, Bhaskar Rao hides Raja in a secret place claiming that he has been sent to a foreign for treatment. On the other side, Anakamma becomes pregnant, gives birth to a baby, and reaches the palace when Bhaskar Rao necks her out. Yugandhar spots all these atrocities, fortuitously, he encounters the elder one Ramu (again N. T. Rama Rao) and reveals the entire story. Now Ramu decides to teach a lesson to Bhaskar Rao he enters the palace as Raja, but Jaya recognizes him when Ramu divulges the truth, so, she too joins him and they fall in love. At Present, Bhaskar Rao is stuck in between, so, he guns Ankanmma on Ramu. In that predicament, Ramu accepts her as his wife, afterward, he clearly explains the reality, all of them play a drama that starts teasing Bhaskar Rao, finding the whereabouts of Raja and safeguarding him in the circus company. Eventually, Bhaskar Rao detects their play and plans to kill Raja. Knowing it, Ramu rushes to the circus and saves him. In that quarrel, Raja gets back his memory and both of them see the end of Bhaskar Rao. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Ramu & Jaya.\n\nParagraph 5: The Huaorani arrived at Palm Beach around 3:00 p.m., and in order to divide the foreigners before attacking them, they sent three women to the other side of the river. One, Dawa, remained hidden in the jungle, but the other two showed themselves. Two of the missionaries waded into the water to greet them, but were attacked from behind by Nampa. Apparently attempting to scare him, Elliot, the first missionary to be speared, pulled out his pistol and began firing. One of these shots mildly injured Dawa, still hidden, and another grazed the missionary's attacker after he was grabbed from behind by one of the women. Accounts differ on the effect of that bullet. Missionaries interpreted the testimonies of Dawa and Dayuma to mean that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, but others, including missionary anthropologist James Yost, came to believe that his death was a result of the bullet wound.  Rachel Saint did not accept this, holding that eyewitnesses supported her position, but researcher Laura Rival, a critic of the expedition, suggests that it is now commonly believed among Huaorani that Nampa died of the wound. The other missionary in the river, Fleming, before being speared, desperately reiterated friendly overtures and asked the Huaorani why they were killing them. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors, led by Gikita, attacked the three missionaries still on the beach, spearing Saint first, then McCully as he rushed to stop them. Youderian ran to the airplane to get to the radio, but he was speared as he picked up the microphone to report the attack. The Huaorani then threw the men's bodies and their belongings in the river, and ripped the fabric from their aircraft. They then returned to their village and, anticipating retribution, burned it to the ground and fled into the jungle.\n\nParagraph 6: Male upperside creamy-white. Forewing: base and costal margin densely irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales; a broad short velvety black bar across middle of cell, another along the discocellulars and a third beyond apex of cell, this last with superposed spots of crimson where the bar crosses the bases of interspaces 5 and 8; a crimson-centred black spot in middle of interspace 1; an irregularly curved prominent postdiscal series of dusky-black spots, so arranged as to leave a narrow edging of the creamy-white ground colour beyond, which is traversed by the black veins; the upper four spots of the postdiscal series fused to form a broad, continuous, but short, curved band; the terminal margin broadly dusky black; the cilia white. Both the dusky-black band and the postdiscal dusky-black markings subhyaline (almost glass like). Hindwing: base and dorsal margin broadly dusky black, the inner margin of the black colouration on the latter deeply but irregularly bi-emarginate; a crimson-centred black spot near base of interspace 5, another just beyond the middle of interspace 7, followed by a very conspicuous curved postdiscal series of five dull blue ocelli ringed with black and centred with white, and a narrow diffuse dusky black terminal band; cilia as in the forewing. Underside: similar, with a glassy appearance. Forewing: with the markings of the upperside visible by transparency; the white scaling of the upperside replaced by scale-like hairs of the same colour; the only scaled markings are the medial and apical transverse black bars in cell, three small crimson spots beyond and the black-encircled crimson spot in middle of interspace 1. Hindwing: the white scaling along the basal half of the costal margin nearly as on the upperside, the rest hair-like as on the underside of the forewing; a broad basal band of four crimson or vermilion-red spots followed by a discal irregular series of five similarly-coloured spots, the lower three formed into a short obliquely transverse band above the tornal angle; all the crimson spots encircled more or less obsoletely by black rings, and the following prominently centred with white: the spot in interspaces 2 and 5 and the basal and medial spots in interspace 7.\n\nParagraph 7: “Baba [Swami Muktananda] had just begun delivering his discourse with his opening statement: ‘Today’s subject is meditation. The crux of the question is: What do we meditate upon?’ Continuing his talk, Baba said: ‘Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats Om Namah Shivaya.’Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra, I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising kundalini force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of \"I am,\" realizing that \"I\" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure \"I am,\" a state of supreme bliss. Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba shouted delightedly from his platform, \"Mene kuch nahi kiya; kisiko shakti ne pakda\" (\"I didn’t do anything. The Energy has caught someone\"). Baba noticed that the dramatic awakening of kundalini in me frightened some people in the audience. Therefore, he said, ‘Do not be frightened. Sometimes kundalini gets awakened in this way, depending upon a person's type.\n\nParagraph 8: Built around the once extensive mining industry, Blackhall's colliery closed in 1981. Daniel Hall was one of the founding fathers of the colliery and invested heavily in the establishment of the mining infrastructure in the area. It is believed but unconfirmed that the name Black-Hall was established as a result of Daniels alias 'Black' due to his association with the mining of coal and his surname Hall. In 1991 a local campaign to erect a statue of Mr Hall was unsuccessful due to a lack of available funding from the local Authority. There is now an industrial estate built over part of the old colliery buildings, the colliery itself was pulled down in the 1980s. Blackhall Colliery is on the edge of Castle Eden Dene, and Castle Eden Dene Mouth.\n\nParagraph 9: In 2016, Strathdee enlisted the help of an international team of physicians and researchers to save her husband's life with bacteriophage (phage) therapy after he acquired a life-threatening infection with a 'superbug', Acinetobacter baumannii. Although phage therapy had been used for one hundred years in Eastern Europe, it was not licensed for clinical use in the United States or most of Western Europe.  Her husband, Tom Patterson, appears to be the first person in the U.S. to be successfully cured from a systemic multi-drug-resistant bacterial infection with cocktails of intravenous bacteriophages. After the case was published, it received considerable attention in top medical journals including JAMA  and Lancet, as well as numerous reports in the international press, including a TEDx talk and a presentation at the LIFE ITSELF conference. The Guardian listed this case as one of the top science stories of 2017.  Since her husband's release from hospital in 2016, Strathdee and her physician friend, Robert \"Chip\" Schooley, who was responsible for treating her husband, have been actively involved in helping other patients  receive phage therapy  and have launched the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH), the first phage therapy center in North America at UCSD which is assisting patients with life-threatening superbug infections obtain treatment. IPATH's goal is to conduct translational research and rigorous clinical trials to determine if phage therapy is efficacious to enable its licensure and widespread use. Patterson made a full recovery and returned to work in April 2017. Strathdee and her husband have written a book about their story called The Perfect Predator: A Scientists's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug, which was published by Hachette Book Group in 2019. As a result of the Patterson case, dozens other patients with multidrug resistant bacterial infections have been treated with intravenous phage therapy with the help of IPATH, including Joel Grimwood and Isabelle Carnell-Holdaway. Joel Grimwood was a patient who was ineligible for heart transplantation due to antimicrobial resistant infection. With phage and antibiotic infusions, Grimwood was able to become healthy enough to undergo a successful heart transplantation. Isabelle Carnell-Holdaway was a 15-year-old patient that underwent experimental treatment in which she was the first person in the world to be administered genetically modified phages to fight a multi-drug resistant infection following lung transplantation. IPATH is a clinical site in the first NIH-funded trial of intravenous phage therapy that launched in October 2022.\n\nParagraph 10: In the following years, the FLB carried out attacks against administrative structures, such as electrical installations, police barracks and statues—mainly by bombing them. The number of attacks peaked in 1968. However, the FLB ensured that no physical injuries or deaths would result from their attacks, which they wished to remain purely symbolic. In this they followed the model of the earlier group Gwenn ha du. They thus gained a reputation in the international community as the \"smiling terrorists.\" There are even reports that the only two known FLB victims during this period were two FLB members themselves, who were killed while trying to defuse a bomb they were afraid may hurt civilians."}
{"queries": ["The introduction of \"all-steel\" car bodies had a significant impact on car factories and the production of cars. The heavy presses required to make the steel panels were expensive, leading many German auto-makers to purchase car bodies from one factory in Berlin. In France, larger auto-makers invested in establishing their own press-shops to manufacture the bodies. Regardless of where the bodies were sourced, heavy investment was necessary for the dies to make the individual panels, which were often different for each car model. However, once the investment in pressing equipment was made, the production of individual car bodies became faster and cheaper compared to the previous timber-framed carriages. By 1928, a successor to the \"all-steel\" bodied car was being produced at a rate of 400 cars per day, accounting for 30% of the cars produced in France. The challenge for auto-makers and investors was the upfront capital cost and finding ways to finance it over the production cycle. Despite the challenges, producing cars with all-steel bodies proved to be profitable for leading automakers, allowing them to gain market share while smaller competitors struggled. Citroën faced financial difficulties in the years leading up to its 1935 bankruptcy, partially due to the cost implications of being the first European auto-maker to use all-steel bodies. However, with Michelin's ownership, Citroën survived and became one of the leading French car makers until 1974, thanks to their adoption of the \"all-steel\" car body technology.", "The text describes the interior structure of a church, specifically focusing on the columns, intervals, and windows.

In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats. Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, \"the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced.\" The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (huo jian 火箭) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket. Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, \"From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes.\" A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the History of Jin: \"The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [所爇圍半畝之上, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor.\" A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: \"When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time.\" Furthermore, he wrote, \"When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Monte Irvin's daring baserunning got the Giants off to a fast start in this New York – New York series.

He sent the first Finnish radiosonde aloft in December 1931. After the first sounding, Väisälä continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into production and deliveries started in 1936. From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. Väisälä established a company called Mittari Oy (\"Gauge Incorporated\") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems.  The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a calibration device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1872 a Lutheran congregation formed in the area as the nearest Lutheran church was in Beenleigh. The congregation held its first service  in the open air under a fig tree on Mr Heineman's land and later in his barn.  of land were purchased on the corner of the south-western corner of Mount Cotton Road and Wuduru Roads (now within the neighbouring suburb of Cornubia to the south, ). Three acres were cleared to build a church and establish a cemetery. In December 1875, Pastor Haussman dedicated the church to St Paul. The church was built in a traditional north German style with hand-made brick nogging within a timber frame. By 1941, the church building was showing signs of age and the congregation decided to have a new church, but there was some debate about the location. On Palm Sunday 19 March 1951, the last service was held in the old church, which was demolished.  On Sunday 11 November 1951, Pastor M. Lohe (President of the Lutheran Church of Queensland) dedicated the second (and current) St Paul's Lutheran Church on the site where the 1872 first service was held. The cemetery beside the old church continued to be used and is now heritage-listed.\n\nParagraph 5: Our hero, Pepe, grew up in Angamalay which is a medium sized suburb of Kochi near the airport.  In middle school he and his friends put together an unofficial “team”, a kind of pretend gang.  They hero-worshipped the leading “team” of their area at that time, which was lead by Babuji and his lieutenant Thomas, and used to work out with them and listen to their advice on fighting and strategy.  As young men, they got into their first fight, with outsiders who were bothering the neighborhood girls.  At the same time, our hero started his first sweet romance with a local girl he had known since school days, Seema.  This innocent period ends when Babuji is killed by two local boys Ravi and Rajan who are then sent to jail. A few years later, Pepe still has the same friends and Thomas, Babuji’s friend, has became a member of their “team” in a kind of adviser capacity.  Pepe is seriously dating a nursing student from Germany and looking for a way to build a business that can support himself and his friends.  They start a pork business, at first just buying pigs from Ravi and Rajan who have become the leading merchants in the neighborhood after their return from jail.  Later they start their own pig farm and set up a rival wholesale business to Ravi and Rajan.  During a discussion between the two groups, Pepe and his friends and Ravi and Raman’s young followers lead by Ravi’s brother-in-law get into a fight.  And Pepe accidentally kills one of them.  INTERVAL To resolve the court case, Pepe’s team has to turn to increasingly illegal activities to raise money to pay off Ravi and Raman and their friends.  They open an illegal poker hall and manage to raise the funds.  However, with the case hanging over him, Pepe feels obligated to end his relationship with the nursing student.  At this point, one of his old friend’s older sisters “Lichi” who has returned to the area starts spending more time with him.  And finally proposes, saying that she doesn’t care about the court cases hanging over him, and she will marry him and take him to Dubai with her.  They are married, but even with the court cases settled, Pepe is still in danger because the man he accidentally killed has cousins who have come to Angamaly for revenge.  Ravi and Rajan act as go-betweens and try to keep the situation calm, but it is still a problem and Pepe needs to get out of town.  In the end, while he is waiting for his Dubai Visa to come through and celebrating a festival (not sure which festival, possibly the Cochin Carnival, possibly Vishu), they give the final pay off to Ravi and Rajan who pass on a portion to the cousins of the victim.  However, the cousins are still angry and plan to attack Pepe now, after they have gotten all the money they can.  During the evening festival celebrations, the groups weave in and out of the procession, and finally the fight starts, but not with Pepe as the victim, but Ravi and Rajan, since the cousins have just learned they only got a small proportion of the money Pepe used to pay them off.  The fight ends after the leader of the cousins, who is also Ravi’s brother-in-law, is chased into the fireworks display and everyone watches in stunned silence as his body is blotted out by thousands of fireworks going off on the ground around it.  In an epilogue, we see Pepe alone in a huge construction crane in Dubai.  It is two years later, he still calls home regularly, and life in Angamaly continues without him.\n\nParagraph 6: Baron Clifton, of Leighton Bromswold in the County of Huntingdon, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1608 for Sir Gervase Clifton, who made Prebendal house which was built by John Thorpe and later owned by the Clifton baronets branch of the family. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. Lord Clifton died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his daughter Katherine, the second Baroness. She married Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (see the Duke of Lennox (1581 creation) for earlier history of this title). They were both succeeded by their eldest son James, the fourth Duke and third Baron. When he died the titles passed to his son, the fifth Duke and fourth Baron. On his death in 1660 at the age of 11, the barony separated from the dukedom. The barony was inherited by the late Duke's sister Mary, the fifth Baroness. She married Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran, but died aged only 18. She was succeeded by her first cousin the sixth Duke of Lennox, who became the sixth Baron Clifton as well. He was the son of Lord George Stuart, the fourth son of the third Duke and the second Baroness Clifton. On his death, the barony and dukedom again separated.\n\nParagraph 7: The Leyden Fine Arts program is composed of music, art and theatrical performance. Various music groups, ranging from choral groups to instrumental orchestras, have excelled in multiple regional, state and national competitions. Choral participants have consistently been top performers in the Illinois Music Educators Association (IMEA) competitions, both in the Jazz and Classical divisions. The Leyden Chamber Singers annually perform in the Madrigal Dinner, singing pieces from the . The Marching Band has also travelled to various locations throughout the United States, including Pennsylvania, Florida, among other locations. Student performers have also been participants of the Illinois High School Theater Association's (IHSTA's), annual TheaterFest. Students throughout the state compete for roles in the annual performance of a classical musical or drama production. The Speech and Performance Team is also a competitive group which has continued to develop and fine-tune their Forensics Speaking abilities throughout the years, with various events in Dramatic and Humorous Interpretation, Radio Speaking, Poetry Reading, and Oratorical Declamation.\n\nParagraph 8: The interior structure of the church is characterized by the twelve free-standing columns that support the nave's elevated central space. On the long side of the church there is a double interval between the second and third pillars, but with a half pillar resting on the lower bracing beam (the pier) which runs in between. The double interval provides free access from the south portal to the church's central compartment, which would otherwise have been obstructed by the middle bar. The tops of the poles are finished with grotesque, carved human and animal masks. The tie-bars are secured with braces in the form of St. Andrew's crosses with a sun - shaped center and carved leaf shapes along the arms. The crosses reappear in less ornate form as braces along the church walls. On the north and south sides of the nave, a total of eight windows let in small amounts of light, and at the top of the nave's west gable is a window of more recent date - probably from pre-Reformation times. On the south wall of the nave, the inauguration crosses are still on the inside of the wall. The interior choir walls and west portal have engraved figures and runes, some of which date to the Middle Ages. One, among the commonest of runic graffiti, reads \"Ave Maria\". An inscription by Þórir (Thor), written \"in the evening at St. Olav's Mass\" blames the pagan Norns for his problems; perhaps a residue of ancient beliefs, as these female beings were thought to rule the personal destinies of all in Norse mythology and the Poetic Edda.\n\nParagraph 9: West African populations were considerably mobile and interacted with one another throughout the population history of West Africa. Acheulean tool-using archaic humans may have dwelled throughout West Africa since at least between 780,000 BP and 126,000 BP (Middle Pleistocene). During the Pleistocene, Middle Stone Age peoples (e.g., Iwo Eleru people, possibly Aterians), who dwelled throughout West Africa between MIS 4 and MIS 2, were gradually replaced by incoming Late Stone Age peoples, who migrated into West Africa as an increase in humid conditions resulted in the subsequent expansion of the West African forest. West African hunter-gatherers occupied western Central Africa (e.g., Shum Laka) earlier than 32,000 BP, dwelled throughout coastal West Africa by 12,000 BP, migrated northward between 12,000 BP and 8000 BP as far as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania, and persisted as late as 1000 BP or some period of time after 1500 CE. During the Holocene, sedentary farming developed in West Africa among the ancestors of modern West Africans. The Iron industry, in both smelting and forging for tools and weapons, appeared in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BCE, and by 400 BCE, contact had been made with the Mediterranean civilizations, and a regular trade included exporting gold, cotton, metal, and leather in exchange for copper, horses, salt, textiles, beads, and slaves. The Tichitt culture developed in 2200 BCE and lasted until around 200 BCE. The Nok culture developed in 1500 BCE and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 CE. Serer people constructed the Senegambian stone circles between 3rd century BCE and 16th century CE. The Sahelian kingdoms were a series of kingdoms or empires that were built on the Sahel, the area of grasslands south of the Sahara.  They controlled the trade routes across the desert, and were also quite decentralised, with member cities having a great deal of autonomy. The Ghana Empire may have been established as early as the 3rd century CE. It was succeeded by the Sosso in 1230, the Mali Empire in the 13th century CE, and later by the Songhai and Sokoto Caliphate. There were also a number of forest empires and states in this time period.\n\nParagraph 10: \"All-steel\" car bodies transformed the look, the noise and the smell car factories.  They also transformed the economics of making cars.  The heavy presses needed to make the steel panels were expensive, which was leading to a situation in Germany whereby many auto-makers would soon be buying their car bodies from one Ambi-Budd factory in Berlin.  In France larger auto-makers, starting with Citroën, but fairly soon followed by Peugeot and Renault (who got themselves into an acrimonious litigation with Ambi-Budd over alleged patent infringements) invested in order to establish their own press-shops.  Regardless of whether the bodies came from an Ambi-Budd factory in Berlin or were stamped using presses in the manufacturer's own premises, further heavy investment was needed for the dies to make the individual panels which more often than not were different for each car model.  Nevertheless, once that investment in pressing equipment had been incurred, the individual cars bodies were much quicker and cheaper to produce than the old timber framed horseless carriages.  By 1928 the B10's \"all-steel\" bodied successor, the B12, was being produced at the rate of 400 cars per day, and accounted for 30% of the cars produced in France at the time.  The challenge, not just for the auto-makers, but also for their accountants, bankers and other investors, involved record creation and paying to amortize the up-front capital cost over a series of cars that might be in production for five years or more.  Provided that the burden of financing the initial capital investment could be sustained until it had been paid off through the production and sale of sufficient cars, producing cars with all-steel bodies could be very profitable, with the added bonus that France's second tier auto-makers would never be able to contemplate the capital investment necessary, so that through the later 1920s and 1930s the leading automakers in the volume sector relentlessly gained market share while smaller competitors fell by the wayside.  The troubled state of Citroën's finances during the ten-year run-up to their 1935 bankruptcy, and the relative dearth of major model changes involving new bodywork, suggest that Citroën and their bankers struggled to master the cost implications of being the first auto-maker in Europe to build cars using all-steel car bodies. Citroën's survival, following its bankruptcy, under Michelin ownership, as one of the leading French car makers between 1935 and 1974 nevertheless was only possible because they were one of a handful of French automakers that adopted the \"all-steel\" car body technology having launched the chassis-less unibody Citroën Traction Avant."}

Though the probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is low, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically used. The advantage of using two-photon excitation is that it improves the extent along the z dimension, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut.

Released as a Virtual Boy launch game, it requires the player to pilot a space fighter and defeat the army of a malevolent artificial intelligence called \"KAOS\". The game takes inspiration from the 1993 title Star Fox, and it is one of the few third-party titles for the Virtual Boy. Unlike most of the console's games, Red Alarm features three-dimensional (3D) polygonal graphics. However, hardware constraints limited the visuals to bare wire-frame models, similar to those of the 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Reviewers characterized Red Alarms graphics as confusing, but certain publications praised it as one of the most enjoyable Virtual Boy titles.\n\nParagraph 2: This experiment included the ultraviolet spectrograph package carried by the IUE, consisting of two physically distinct echelle-spectrograph/camera units capable of astronomical observations. Each spectrograph was a three-element echelle system composed of an off-axis paraboloidal collimator, an echelle grating, and a spherical first-order grating that was used to separate the echelle orders and focus the spectral display on an image converter plus SEC Vidicon camera. There was a spare camera for each unit. The camera units were able to integrate the signal. The readout/preparation cycle for the cameras took approximately 20 minutes. Wavelength calibration was provided by the use of a hollow cathode comparison lamp. The photometric calibration was accomplished by observing standard stars whose spectral fluxes had previously been calibrated by other means. Both echelle-spectrograph/camera units were capable of high-resolution (0.1 Angstrom (A)) or low-resolution (6 A) performance. The dual high/low-resolution capability was implemented by the insertion of a flat mirror in front of the echelle grating, so that the only dispersion was provided by the spherical grating. As the SEC Vidicons could integrate the signal for up to many hours, data with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 could be obtained for B0 stars of 9th and 14th magnitudes in the high- and low-resolution modes, respectively. The distinguishing characteristic of the units was their wavelength coverage. One unit covered the wavelength range from 1192 to 1924 A in the high-resolution mode and 1135 to 2085 A in the low-resolution mode. For the other unit, the ranges were from 1893 to 3031 A and 1800 to 3255 A for the high-and low-resolution modes, respectively. Each unit also had its own choice of entrance apertures: either a 3-arcsecond hole or a 10- by 20-arcsecond slot. The 10- by 20-arcsecond slots could be blocked by a common shutter, but the 3-arcsecond aperture was always open. As a result, two aperture configurations were possible: (1) both 3-arcsecond apertures open and both 10- by 20-arcsecond slots closed, or (2) all four apertures open. With this instrumentation, the observational options open to an observer were long-wavelength and/or short-wavelength spectrograph, high or low resolution, and large or small apertures. Exposures could be made with the two spectrographs simultaneously, but the entrance apertures for each were distinct and separated in the sky by about 1 arcminute. An additional restriction was that data could be read out from only one camera at a time. However, one camera could be exposed while the other camera was being read out. The choice of high or low resolution could be made independently for the two spectrographs.\n\nParagraph 3: The English rock group the Rolling Stones have released 30 studio albums, 13 live albums, 29 compilation albums, three extended plays, 121 singles, 33 box sets, 50 video albums and 77 music videos.

The young, light yellow to dark brown branches are densely hairy but become hairless as the branches mature. The branches also have sparse lenticels. Its elliptical, membranous to papery leaves are 9-17 by 4-8.5 centimeters. The leaves have rounded to flat bases and tapering tips, with the tapering portion 5-18 millimeters long. The leaves are hairless on their upper surfaces and slightly hairy on their lower surfaces. The leaves have 8-12 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. Its densely hairy petioles are 2-5 by 0.8-2.5 millimeters with a broad groove on their upper side. Its solitary Inflorescences occur on branches, and are organized on indistinct peduncles. Each inflorescence has a solitary flower. Each flower is on a sparsely to very densely hairy pedicel that is 20-45 by 0.3-0.8 millimeters. The pedicels are organized on a rachis up to 5 millimeters long that have 2 bracts. The pedicels have a medial, very densely hairy bract that is 0.7-1.2 millimeters long. Its flowers are male or hermaphroditic. Its flowers have 3 triangular sepals, that are 1.5-3 by 1-2 millimeters. The sepals are hairless on their upper surface, sparsely to densely hairy on their lower surface, and hairy at their margins. Its 6 petals are arranged in two rows of 3.

The seeds are wrinkly.\n\nParagraph 5: The two PVA battalions attacking on the Marine right had their greatest success at Boulder City, seizing a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines. In an attempt to exploit this foothold, the PVA attacked the Berlin and East Berlin gates, passages through the wire that the Marines had used to supply and reinforce the two outposts before both were overwhelmed. Cloud cover prevented aerial observers from supporting the troops protecting the gates, and the PVA managed to gain control of Berlin gate and mount a second determined assault on the Boulder City perimeter. Hand-to-hand fighting raged all along the  of trench that Lieutenant Swigart's Marines still held. The company's ammunition ran low, and the plight of casualties became increasingly difficult as PVA fire killed two of Boulder City's eight corpsmen and wounded most of the others. By midnight, Swigart's company could muster no more than half its earlier strength, but it still clung to the rear slope of Boulder City. Casualties had further eroded the strength of the Boulder City garrison, when at 00:15 on the 25th, Company I, 3/1 Marines, moved toward the hill to reinforce Swigart's survivors. The PVA intercepted and correctly interpreted the coded radio message ordering the Company I Marines forward, thus obtaining information that enabled their artillery and mortars to wound or kill about a third of the reinforcements. Despite the deadly barrage, much of Company I reached Boulder City, joined forces with the remnants of Swigart's garrison, and took part in a counterattack that recaptured the hill by 03:30. Further reinforcements from Company E, 2/7 Marines, and Company E, 2/1 Marines, arrived by 05:30 to consolidate the position. A few PVA, however, continued to cling to positions on the slopes nearest the MLR. Since the PVA still controlled the approaches to Boulder City, they were able to mount another attack on that position at 08:20, 25 July. Fire from Marine mortars and artillery, and from the 90mm weapons of 10 tanks dug in on the Marine positions, played the key role in breaking up the new assault, although the last of the attackers did not withdraw until afternoon. The M-46 tanks proved deadly against advancing PVA troops, but also presented an inviting target for PVA artillery and mortar crews, who directed some 2,200 rounds at the armored vehicles. Aircraft also helped repulse the 25 July attack on Boulder City, as when F9F jets flew nine missions, guided by ground radar, against positions threatening Boulder City and nearby defensive strongpoints.\n\nParagraph 6: Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy has similarities to other confocal laser microscopy techniques such as laser scanning confocal microscopy and Raman microscopy. These techniques use focused laser beams scanned in a raster pattern to generate images, and both have an optical sectioning effect. Unlike confocal microscopes, multiphoton microscopes do not contain pinhole apertures that give confocal microscopes their optical sectioning quality. The optical sectioning produced by multiphoton microscopes is a result of the point spread function of the excitation: the multiphoton point spread function is typically dumbbell-shaped (longer in the x-y plane), compared to the upright rugby-ball shaped point spread function of confocal microscopes. The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two photons, of comparably lower photon energy than needed for one photon excitation, can also excite a fluorophore in one quantum event. Each photon carries approximately half the energy necessary to excite the molecule. Excitation results in the subsequent emission of a fluorescence photon with the same quantum yield that would result from conventional single-photon absorption. The emitted photon is typically at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than either of the two exciting photons. The probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is extremely low. Therefore, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically required, usually generated by femtosecond pulsed laser. The purpose of employing the two-photon effect is that the axial spread of the point spread function is substantially lower than for single-photon excitation. As a result, the extent along the z dimension is improved, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut. In addition, in many interesting cases the shape of the spot and its size can be designed to realize specific desired goals. The longer wavelength, lower energy (typically infrared) excitation lasers of multiphoton microscopes are well-suited to use in imaging live cells as they cause less damage than the short-wavelength lasers typically used for single-photon excitation, so cells may be observed for longer periods with fewer toxic effects.\n\nParagraph 7: Forever in our hearts, Ezzrett \"Sugarfoot\" Anderson, beloved family patriarch and legendary Calgarian passed away on Wednesday, March 8, 2017, at the Foothills Hospital. Sugarfoot, whose gridiron nickname became a lifelong signature, lived a full and fruitful 97 years. He was born in Nashville, Arkansas, on February 10, 1920, to parents Florence and Ezzrett Anderson Sr. a renowned baseball player in the old Negro Leagues.His was a sporting life which started in his early school years and continued at Kentucky State where he earned a spot on an all-America football team. While there he met his first wife Virnetta, from Hot Springs Arkansas. In 1943 they joined their extended family in moving to California to help with the war effort. \"Sug\", as he was often called, was a two-way star who could pass, catch and defend. He soon attracted the attention of the pros, playing with the Hollywood Bears of the Pacific Coast League in 1945-46 and the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference in 1947. During those years Sugarfoot also found work in the movie industry, appearing in over 20 films, including a speaking role in the original \"Story of Seabiscuit\" with Shirley Temple and Barry Fitzgerald.In 1949, the Calgary Stampeders like many CFL team were seeking to bolster the Canadian game with some experienced U.S. talent. And, though Sugarfoot had retired from play, he was persuaded by old friend Woody Strode and storied coach Les Lear to bring his speed and versatility to Calgary. He became an instant star and popular figure both on and off the field for his talent, easygoing style and affable, bigger-than-life personality. He was an all-star CFL player in '49 when the Stamps lost to the Montreal Alouettes in the Grey Cup and was one of only two Americans to make all-pro in Canada at both offence and defense. And the only player in franchise history to wear the iconic \"00\". He retired at the end of 1955, was added to the Stampeders' Wall of Fame in 1990 and inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.His years off the field were no less colourful. From 1950 to 1955 Sugarfoot had a popular radio show on CKXL, fronted a blues band called \"The Bluenotes\", and made many appearances on stage and at events supporting charities and enriching Calgary's culture and music scene. In 2013 he was presented with the \"Canada's Recording Legacy Award of Recognition\".Sugarfoot attended SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology), where he received his Red Seal as a Heavy Duty mechanic. He owned his own service station in the heart of downtown Calgary and went on to work for the group of companies that included Standard General, Inland Cement and Genstar retiring after 32 years.Sugarfoot always maintained his connection to the Stampeders: spending many years as an account representative and ambassador for the team \"which allowed him to collect what had eluded him during his playing days 5 treasured Grey Cup rings. He was a fixture at McMahon Stadium a respected elder statesman and mentor from the practice field to the locker room and a tireless promoter at team events, with the Calgary Stampeders Alumni Association and all around town. Sugar always appreciated the opportunities provided him by the Stamps and his adopted city, and he was never happier than when he was out in public, meeting new people, telling stories and sharing his unique humour. Of course, the family will remember him most for our private joy his love of fatherhood, and the great and special love he shared for over 30 years with his devoted wife Anne English. Ezzrett is also survived by sons Barry and John, granddaughters Camille, Desta, Sonja, Vinessa, Jacquilyn and Nikki, grandsons Jonathan and Mark and many extended family and friends. He is pre-deceased by his first wife Virnetta and son Vaughn.Sugarfoot stayed active well into his 90's.\n\nParagraph 8: In February and March 1814, Mariño and his forces fought alongside Bolívar. They regrouped at Valencia and Bolívar handed over command to Mariño, \"as a sure sign of his high opinion of his person and services, and also in this way to ensure the adhesion of the eastern officers to the common cause of Venezuela.\" However, due to their series of repeated reverses they both had to retreat from central Venezuela to the port of Carúpano. Bolívar and Mariño were arrested and removed from power by José Félix Ribas and Manuel Piar, each representing the two republican commands then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On 8 September, after the fall of the second republic, Bolívar and Mariño set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.  In 1815 Bolivar and Mariño left for Jamaica and Haiti. In 1816 participated in the first expedition of Les Cayes and arriving at Venezuela was named second of the Liberator. Defeated in Ocumare de la Costa Bolívar returned from Haiti to Barcelona calling on all to join together, but first Bermúdez and Valdéz rebelled against Mariño, and then Mariño against Bolívar. In 1816 Bolívar used the island of Margarita as his base of operations and, in 1817, the Spanish General Pablo Morillo was driven off the island. He inspired the Cariaco Congress with Jose Cortés de Madariaga, in which federalism was revived in Venezuela, that caused a clash with Bolivar that dissolved the Congress. As a deputy, Mariño represented the province of Cumaná in the second Congress of Venezuela, meeting in Angostura on 15 February 1819, from which he had the license to return to the army. That same year, it triumphed over the colonel Eugenio Arana in the combat of Cantaura and while Bolivar operated in the liberation of Viceroyalty of New Granada took part in the movement that displaced Francisco Antonio Zea of the vice-presidency of the Republic. In his place was named the general in chief Juan Bautista Arismendi, and Mariño was nominated commander in chief of the army of the east. Once Bolivar arrived in the city of Angostura, Mariño was promoted as the General Staff.\n\nParagraph 9: Margaret Branson took Powell to her mother's boarding house at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore. Maryland was split during the Civil War. West of the Atlantic Fall Line the central and western parts of the state largely being settled by Germans from Pennsylvania and other Northerners during the 18th Century, tended to support the Union, as evidenced by Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks plan to stop secession by moving the Maryland General Assembly to Frederick, where on April 29, 1861, secession had been voted down 53–13, this taking place before Maryland was placed under martial law. East of the Fall line, the city of Baltimore and all of the land between the Mason-Dixon Line and the Potomac and the Eastern Shore for the most part was peopled by Confederate sympathizers, who either directly or indirectly aided the Confederacy. The few exceptions to this rule, such as Hicks successor Augustus Bradford had his home in North Baltimore burned to the ground in 1864 by Frederick native Confederate General Bradley T Johnson and his Maryland troops. Johnson was the first to concoct the idea of kidnapping President Lincoln while he was visiting the soldiers home, but whether there were any direct connections to Booth and Powell are unknown.\n\nParagraph 10: An early pioneer in the area was William Franklin Smith, who herded sheep from the Sherwood area of Irion County to the Pecos River and camped at Pecos in the spring of 1886. Smith made several trips to Pecos County and eventually relocated permanently to Sheffield in 1912. The first settler was John Cannon, who arrived in 1888 and purchased a tract along the Pecos River. A post office was established in 1898, with Will Sheffield as its first postmaster. Around 1900, a small settlement sprang up on land adjoining the Cannon ranch owned by Mr. Sheffield, and the town became known as Sheffield. Most other settlers were ranchers who established their own homesteads. However, a few of the early pioneers were later reputed to be outlaws seeking a refuge far from the reach of the law. Black Jack Ketchum, later a notorious outlaw wanted in several states, was among these, spending time in the area in the 1890s. The town prospered in the early 1900s as a supply point and social center for surrounding ranchers. Sheffield became a small stop on the transcontinental route known as the Old Spanish Trail beginning in the 1920s. One of the local motels there was the OST Courts (The old sign for this establishment was still in place in 2015). The discovery of oil in the Trans-Pecos region during the 1920s radically altered the local economy. Sheffield became a stopping point for traveling motorists when the Old Spanish Trail  was developed through West Texas. The route later became U.S. Highway 290. Sheffield grew slowly, from an estimated 124 inhabitants in 1925 to 350 by 1949. Natural gas production was introduced in 1971. Although the community was bypassed by Interstate 10, Sheffield continued to support several stores and businesses throughout the latter half of the 20th century. In 2000, Sheffield was home to an estimated 600 inhabitants and 15 businesses."}

(Talmud Gittin 56a.) At that time, Martha sent her manservant out to bring her some fine flour, but it had sold out. After that, the manservant is repeatedly sent out to buy the next-lesser quality of flour (white flour - dark flour - barley flour) only to find it sold out as well. Finally, the desperate woman went out to see if she could find anything to eat without even putting on her shoes, but stepping in some dung, she died of shock. According to Rashi, the reason for her death was the feeling of extreme disgust that gripped her until she died because of her delicacy. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai thus applied to her the Biblical verse, \"The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground.\" ()The second opinion holds that, while walking down the street, she saw figs on the floor, and began to eat, and died. These figs were those of Rabbi Zadok, who fasted for 40 years so that Jerusalem would not be destroyed by the Romans and when he wanted to restore himself, they used to bring him a fig, and he used to suck the juice and throw the rest away.Martha felt in these figs that he sucked them because of his sickness, you tasted his sickness and because she did get sick and soon after died. (Talmud Gittin 56a.) When Martha was about to die, she brought out all her gold and silver and threw it in the street, saying, \"What is the good of this to me\", thus giving effect to the verse, \"They shall cast their silver in the streets.\" ()  (Talmud Gittin 56a.)\n\nParagraph 2: We believe in one God the Father Almighty, of whom are all things.

We know that this only-begotten Son of God, as sent of the Father, came down from the heavens, as it is written, for the destruction of sin and death: and that he was born of the Holy Spirit, and of the Virgin Mary according to the flesh, as it is written, and conversed with his disciples; and that after every dispensation had been fulfilled according to his Father's will, he was crucified and died, and was buried and descended into the lower parts of the earth, at whose presence hades itself trembled: who also arose from the dead on the third day, again conversed with his disciples, and after the completion of forty days was taken up into the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Father, whence he will come in the last day, the day of the resurrection, in his Father's glory, to requite every one according to his works. [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, whom he himself the only-begotten of God, Christ our Lord and God, promised to send to mankind as the Comforter, according as it is written, \"the Spirit of truth;\" whom he sent to them after he was received into the heavens.But since the term ousia [substance or essence], which was used by the fathers in a very simple and intelligible sense, but not being understood by the people, has been a cause of offense, we have thought proper to reject it, as it is not contained even in the sacred writings; and that no mention of it should be made in future, inasmuch as the holy Scriptures have nowhere mentioned the substance of the Father and of the Son. Nor ought the \"subsistence\" of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit to be even named. But we affirm that the Son is similar to the Father, in such a manner as the sacred Scriptures declare and teach. Let therefore all heresies which have been already condemned, or may have arisen of late, which are opposed to this exploitation of the faith, be anathema.\n\nParagraph 3: With its \"Vietnamization\" doctrine, proclaimed in early 1969, the Nixon administration began the gradual withdrawal of the United States from ground combat in South Vietnam. The end goal of this was to strengthen the military of South Vietnam. An expanded program of irregular operations in the eastern Panhandle was more productive. There was a lot of pressure for Nixon to withdraw from Indochina on the home front. Johnson's bombing of North Vietnam in 1968 really got backlash from the citizens back in America. There were a lot of protests all over the United States because of this. Even though the war was ending in Vietnam, protestors in the United States were still going crazy as the troops were returning from the battlefield. During the Nixon Presidency, domestic pressure to withdrawal from Indochina exponentially increased. However, Nixon was determined to escape the embarrassment of an American military defeat in Vietnam. Needing to rectify the aggravated electorate and ensure the prospects of shaping the settlement in Vietnam from a position of strength, Nixon and Kissinger turned to the CIA. Kissinger ordered the CIA to carry out “high political and psychological impact actions against military targets in North Vietnam.” The Agency sponsored Laotian guerrillas to erode the enemy's confidence in the security of the trail network. On 22 February 1970, the Commando Raider operations began and set ablaze administrative and storage buildings in Dien Bien Phu, and sabotaged a pipeline near Mu Gia Pass. The success of these operations enticed the CIA station in Vientiane to adopt them as a staple of its agenda. The change of government's Cambodia in March 1970 signaled an opportunity to expand the Commando Raider operations. The CIA gathered more intelligence pertaining to the specifics of troop movements and the location of NVA supplies. Raids to destroy these supplies became common. The CIA focused on the complete interdiction of the trail system that extended through Laos and Cambodia. While many of these raids were successful, it was a futile operation. The “means [were] inadequate to the end.” The CIA spent a great amount of resources and energy into preparing these raids, collecting intelligence, and carrying out attempts to further undermine the enemy now defeating them. In May 1970, a raid ended in disaster when all but four of 21 members were captured or killed. The use of CIA covert action, particularly by Kissinger, illustrates the tendency of the White House to circumvent domestic or foreign restraints. The President dealt under the table to accomplish its strategic interests while hoping to save face among the electorate. Furthermore, the ultimate failure of CIA covert action reflected a recurring trend in the Agency's history—no matter the amount of intelligence collected, resources amassed, or strategies implemented, the Agency still failed to understand its enemy. Although the CIA had some success in anticipating the North Vietnamese offensive of 1972, the agency's last station chief in South Vietnam argued that \"the illusion that the war is over and we have won is shattered.\"\n\nParagraph 4: The SEC Centre hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Originally scheduled to be held in 2020, the conference was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the same pandemic, the SEC Centre was turned into a COVID-19 critical care hospital under the name NHS Louisa Jordan, and run by NHS Scotland. Initially (as of April 8, 2020), it had capacity for 300 beds, with an expansion to over 1,000 if needed. The venue was never used for COVID-19 critical care and was instead used for medical appointments, blood donations, staff training and COVID-19 vaccinations. Work began in July 2021 to prepare it for hosting the rescheduled Climate Change Conference in October and November 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: From the late 19th century, there had been proposals to build a bridge across the Tagus. In 1929, the idea advanced when the Portuguese engineer and entrepreneur, António Bello, requested a government concession for a railway crossing between Lisbon and Montijo (where the Vasco da Gama Bridge, the second bridge serving Lisbon, was later built in 1998). As a result, the Minister of Public Works, Duarte Pacheco, created a commission in 1933 to analyse the request. The commission reported in 1934, and proposed building a road and rail bridge. Bids were obtained, but the proposal was subsequently put aside in favor of a bridge crossing the river at Vila Franca de Xira,  north of Lisbon.\n\nParagraph 6: At school, Max and Berteli's teacher Miss. Sigrist, take a special interest in Max and encourages him to play his accordion for Wrestler's Day. The family enjoy the evening out on Wrestler's Day during which Jakob attempts to make sexual advances on Miss Sigrist, causing Max to intervene and beat up Jakob. Jakob takes his revenge on Max by burning his accordion. Life gets more unbearable for Berteli when Jakob now visits her room every night to rape her. Berteli tries to run away and return to her mother, who is unable to look after her but still begs the man she's living with to keep Berteli with her. He refuses and Berteli sensing her mother's dilemma, voluntarily leaves and says that she will go back to the Bosigers and that she came to see her because she was homesick. Unable to bear what is happening to them both, Max suggests that they should run away to Argentina where he can become a musician and earn a living. Miss Sigrist, tries to intervene and goes to the authorities to expose the abuse Max and Berteli are going through. Berteli becomes pregnant, and one day a horrified Max sees Jakob going to Berteli's room and confides in Miss Sigrist. Miss Sigrist visits the farm and tells Mrs. Bosiger that Jakob has been having sex with Berteli, upon which Mrs Bosiger becomes furious and throws her out. Miss Sigrist angrily tells Mrs Bosiger that it is her responsibility to care for these two children and not ignore what has been happening to Berteli. Miss Sigrist who has now lost her job because she tried to help Max and Berteli, leaves after giving Max a brand new accordion. Mrs. Bosiger sees Berteli vomiting and asks her why she is sick to which replies that it is because of what Jakob does to  her at night. Mrs. Bosiger gets angry and forces Berteli to admit that she is lying, but however, she does confront Jakob who doesn't admit or deny anything. Mrs. Bosiger makes Berteli to drink a bottle of castor oil as part of a home remedy abortion, and at night Berteli's screams are heard by Max as she starts aborting the baby. A heavily intoxicated Mr. Bosiger prevents Max from going to Berteli and forces him to play his accordion to hide her screams. Max visits Berteli after her contractions stop and Mrs. Bosiger is seen changing the blood stained sheets. The two plan to run away to Argentina as soon as Berteli becomes better, however she dies and it is unclear whether Berteli has committed suicide or succumbed to infection. The authorities investigate and Mrs Bosiger and Jakob claim that Berteli's death was of a suicide. When the Reverend starts to pray before taking Berteli's body away, Max comes shouting the truth behind Berteli's death. Mr. Bosiger shows the authorities the bottle of castor oil that Mrs Bosigner forced Berteli to drink. The authorities are now aware of the abuse foster children suffer and plan to investigate further. \n\nParagraph 7: At 17:30 on the same day, Grandi went to Palazzo Venezia under the official reason of presenting a new book about the Italian participation in the non-intervention committee in Spain to Mussolini. The meeting was scheduled to last 15 minutes, but it was prolonged until 18:45. The Chief of Police and the German Feldmarschall Kesselring were waiting to be received by the Duce. Mussolini later denied that he spoke with Grandi about the OdG, but it is apparent that Grandi, who loved the Duce, explained to him the consequences of his OdG and gave him a chance to save face and resign before the vote. In that case, the Grand Council's meeting would have been superfluous. Mussolini listened while Grandi was explaining the necessity of resigning to avoid a catastrophe, but at the end rebuked him saying that his conclusions were wrong since Germany was about to produce a decisive secret weapon. After that, Mussolini met Kesselring and the Chief of Police, Chierici, whom he confided in that it would have been easy to bring Grandi, Bottai and Ciano back to the fold as they were eager to be persuaded by him. On 23 July, Mussolini accepted the resignation of Cini, which was supposed to be a signal to his opponents. At the same time, Grandi, Federzoni, de Marsico (one of the best jurists in Italy), Bottai and Ciano modified the OdG by removing the interpretative introduction which explained the functions of the Grand Council. This demonstrated that the assembly had the constitutional power to remove Mussolini. According to the constitutionalists, the \"Leggi Fascistissime\" of December 1925 bent the Constitution, but did not break it. Because of these laws, the Duce ruled the country on behalf of the King, who always remained the source of executive power. If the Grand Council, which was the trait d'union between Fascism and the state, passed a vote of no confidence on the dictator, the King would have been entitled to remove him and nominate his successor. Ciano was acquainted with the OdG by Bottai, and Grandi was reluctant to accept him since he was the son-in-law of Mussolini and known for his superficial and inconstant character. However, Ciano insisted, unaware that this decision would provoke his death six months later in Verona. After that, Grandi had Farinacci visit his office in the parliament to show him his OdG. Farinacci told Grandi that he accepted the first part of the document, but that he did not agree with the rest: the military powers had to be given to the Germans, and Italy should start to fight the war by getting rid of Mussolini and the generals. Farinacci asked him for a copy of his OdG, and like Scorza, he used it to produce another OdG of his own. In the time left before the meeting, Grandi contacted other participants asking them to join his action.\n\nParagraph 8: Doreen begins her college career at Empire State University, majoring in computer science. Upon arriving, she ends up fighting Kraven the Hunter, who was lashing out at the local squirrels including Tippy Toe, whom he caught and was about to kill. She stops him by informing him of the existence of sea monsters like Giganto and challenges him to hunt them. Later, she discovers that Galactus is heading to Earth to devour it, and she steals Iron Man's armor and heads to the Moon with Tippy-Toe. On their way, they defeat Whiplash, who had attacked Squirrel Girl, mistaking her for Iron Man. She and Tippy-Toe surprisingly befriend Galactus instead of fighting him, and afterwards tell him of a planet that could sustain him even better than the Earth. This planet is devoid of intelligent life but rich in nuts, which Galactus has developed a new liking for. He then sends the two back home, and he leaves the Earth to live another day. When she arrives back home, her roommate Nancy Whitehead tells her that she has figured out she is a superhero, but promises not to tell anyone, the two becoming good friends. Later, Squirrel Girl and other superheroes defeat Mysterion, who was attacking Liberty Island with an army of robot dinosaurs. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to stop Hippo from robbing a bank, she meets Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi, both of whom have the ability to speak to different animals. Nancy reveals their secret identities (Tomas Lara-Perez and Ken Shiga, respectively) to her, since she easily recognized them under their masks. They later encounter a monstrous Asgardian squirrel god, Ratatoskr, who had been causing mayhem on the city by trash-talking its citizens during their sleep, but is defeated with help from Loki and the current and former Thor.\n\nParagraph 9: The first edition of the QClash took place on 7 May 2011 at the Gabba. The Suns were required to host the inaugural meeting between the two teams at the Gabba as their home ground, Carrara Stadium, was unavailable until later that year. Despite the Lions not having won a game for the season leading into the game, they were considered strong favourites to defeat their Gold Coast neighbours. The Suns had recorded their first ever AFL win two weeks prior to the clash while Brisbane was winless leading into the first ever Queensland derby. In the lead up to the match, triple premiership Lion Simon Black expressed resentment towards the Suns by stating \"the AFL have given them everything, and then some\" as well as labelling former Brisbane players Jared Brennan and Michael Rischitelli \"mercenaries\" because they had joined the Suns in the off season. Gold Coast coach Guy McKenna returned serve by stating that the Suns were brought into the competition to clean up the mess left by the Brisbane Bears, which Lions coach and former Bears player Michael Voss said he took personally and stated that McKenna's comments were \"out of line\". Two days before the game it was revealed that 10 Queenslanders had been chosen to compete in the clash. The Suns got off to a hot start in the first quarter and led the clash by 19 points at first exchange of ends. The Gold Coast held that lead through the first three quarters and the tension rose early in the third term when Gold Coast's David Swallow unintentionally knocked Brisbane's Andrew Raines unconscious, who was taken off with concussion. Trailing by 19 points at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Lions mounted a comeback off the back of six second half goals from Ashley McGrath, who was swung forward at half time. A Todd Banfield goal at the 15-minute mark in the fourth term equaled the scores late in the game but a spectacular pack mark taken by Gold Coast forward Nathan Krakouer a minute later stemmed the tide as he kicked truly for his fifth goal to give the Suns a one-goal lead. McGrath's sixth goal just seconds later again equaled the scores once again. The Gold Coast were awarded a controversial free kick for a high tackle a minute later which allowed small forward Brandon Matera to play on and kick the Suns to a seven-point lead that they wouldn't relinquish. The Suns claim the inaugural QClash 18.16 (124) to 17.14 (116). Former Lion and new Sun Jared Brennan was awarded the inaugural Marcus Ashcroft Medal for his best on ground performance that included 30 disposals and 14 clearances.\n\nParagraph 10: The board of Shadows over Camelot depicts a number of locations, each with an associated quest. At the start of the game, they are: Camelot; the War against the Picts; the War against the Saxons; the tournament against the Black Knight; the quest for Excalibur; the quest for Lancelot's Armor; and the Grail Quest. The quests for the Grail, Excalibur, and Lancelot's armor can only be completed once, whereas the wars and the Black Knight tournament repeat.  Once Lancelot's Armor has been retrieved or lost, the knights have the opportunity to defeat the Dragon.  The success in all quests is determined by the playing of cards, mostly in various sets, and perhaps by the player's willingness to sacrifice their life to further advance a quest for the good for all loyal knights.  For example, Grail cards are used to complete the Grail quest, a set of 1-2-3-4-5 in Fight is needed to complete the wars, and two pair of Fight are needed to complete the Tournament. For group quests, the cooperation of players is crucial for completing them quickly to gain the rewards before the progression of evil takes its toll (either the players' health is too depleted and/or there are too many siege engines). Quests are completed with the knights' success, in which case white swords are added to the Round Table, or by their failure, which results in black swords being added to the table."}

Framed as the mole, with only his teammate Claire Phelps alive, Ethan plots to steal a copy of the list to lure the real traitor out of hiding. Hunt enlists the help of two other \"disavowed\" IMF agents: Luther Stickell and Franz Krieger (portrayed by Jean Reno). Stickell is chosen as \"Cyber-Ops\" for his reputation as a hacker and phreaker. Reluctant at first, Luther is baited into the hack when Ethan plays to Stickell's ego, selling the job proposal as \"the Mount Everest of hacks\". Posing as a team of firefighters, the rogue IMF group breaches the CIA and infiltrates the main computer mainframe via a remote terminal in Langley, Virginia. In order to gain access to the floor with the NOC list, Luther hacks into the building's computer-controlled electrical system, triggering the fire alarm on that floor. Because of his agility, Hunt performs the physical act of obtaining the information himself but has Luther, in his ear via headset, instructing him on performing the hack. Luther, from the team's firetruck parked outside the building, obtains the password to the terminal by hacking into the CIA's online network from a laptop. After obtaining the list, Hunt discovers that his team leader Jim Phelps not only survived the initial mission in Prague, but also is the real mole. He is the man responsible for framing Ethan, despite Jim's insistence that CIA Director Kittridge is the mole. After learning this from Ethan, Luther helps him double-cross Claire and Jim together. Aboard a train headed for Paris, the arms dealer called Max (Ethan's buyer of the NOC list) and her bodyguard are caught with the stolen data, the CIA drops their case against Hunt and reinstates him, along with Luther. While celebrating with Ethan at a British pub, Luther proclaims he is \"the flavor of the month\", indicating that the CIA is now treating him like royalty thanks to his help. At the same time, he muses that he is \"gonna miss being disreputable\" as he is no longer in hiding and incapable of the illegal computer activities he was privy to performing before being reinstated. Before going their separate ways, Hunt smiles and tells Luther that, if it makes him feel any better, he will always see Luther in that light.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1193, Alfonso married Gersenda II of Sabran, daughter of Rainou, Count of Forcalquier of the House of Sabran and Gersend of Forcalquier, daughter of William IV of Forcalquier. Garsenda was named after her mother, who was the heiress of William IV, but predeceased him. Garsenda therefore inherited Forcalquier from her grandfather. She was only thirteen years of age when, in 1193, her grandfather William IV and Alfonso II signed the Treaty of Aix whereby Garsenda would inherit William's county and would marry Alfonso, who was in line to become Count of Provence. The marriage took place at Aix-en-Provence in July 1193.\n\nParagraph 4: Poona was a very important military base with a large cantonment during this era. The cantonment had a significant European population of soldiers, officers, and their families. A number of public health initiatives were undertaken during this period ostensibly to protect the Indian population, but mainly to keep Europeans safe from the periodic epidemics of diseases like Cholera, bubonic plague, small pox, etc. The action took form in vaccinating the population and better sanitary arrangements. The Imperial Bacteriological laboratory was first opened in Pune in 1890, but later moved to Muktesar in the hills of Kumaon. Given the vast cultural differences, and at times the arrogance of colonial officers, the measures led to public anger. The most famous case of the public anger was in 1897, during the bubonic plague epidemic in the city. By the end of February 1897, the epidemic was raging with a mortality rate twice the norm and half the city's population had fled. A Special Plague Committee was formed under the chairmanship of W.C. Rand, an Indian Civil Services officer. He brought European troops to deal with the emergency. The heavy handed measures he employed included forcibly entering peoples' homes, at times in the middle of the night and removing infected people and digging up floors, where it was believed in those days that the plague bacillus bacteria resided. These measures were deeply unpopular. Tilak fulminated against the measures in his newspapers, Kesari and Maratha. The resentment culminated in Rand and his military escort being shot dead by the Chapekar brothers on 22 June 1897. A memorial to the Chapekar brothers exists at the spot on Ganesh Khind Road. The assassination led to a re-evaluation of public health policies. This led even Tilak to support the vaccination efforts later in 1906. In the early 20th century, the Poona Municipality ran clinics dispensing Ayurvedic and regular English medicine. Plans to close the former in 1916 led to protest, and the municipality backed down. Later in the century, Ayurvedic medicine was recognized by the government and a training hospital called Ayurvedic Mahavidyalaya with 80 beds was established in the city. The Seva sadan institute led by Ramabai Ranade was instrumental in starting training in nursing and midwifery at the Sassoon Hospital. A maternity ward was established at the KEM Hospital in 1912. Availability of midwives and better medical facilities was not enough for high infant mortality rates. In 1921, the infant mortality rate was at a peak of 876 deaths per 1000 births.\n\nParagraph 5: Australian riders won each of the lesser jersey awards. Evans won the points classification, represented in 2010 with a red jersey in a return to the original colour scheme for the three minor classifications that reflected the colours of the Italian flag. Evans's victory came about by way of nine top-ten finishes, including a stage win, over the course of the race. This classification was tightly contested throughout the race; six different riders held the jersey, and it changed hands nine times. Matthew Lloyd of  won the green jersey for the mountains classification, taking maximum mountains points during his stage-winning breakaway in stage 6. He made morning breakaways later on in mountain stages to take points on other climbs and consolidate his lead. Porte won the white jersey as best young rider, holding it for all but three stages. Success was widespread among the 22 teams in the race. In sharp contrast to the 2009 Giro, the only rider to win multiple stages in this year's race was Farrar, who took the sprint finishes to stages 2 and 10. , , , , , , , and  each won one stage.  had two stage wins, first with Wouter Weylandt in a depleted sprint finish to stage 3 in the Netherlands, and two stages later Jérôme Pineau led a winning breakaway across the finish line.

After there had been no Italian stage winners for the first 11 days of racing, Pozzato's stage win was the first of five in a row and six overall for Italian riders. Nibali and Basso were among those stage winners; as they also won the stage 4 team time trial, theirs was the only squad with more than two stage wins. They also won both teams classifications, the time-based Trofeo Fast Team and the points-based Trofeo Super Team. , , and  did not win any stages, but Vinokourov's and Arroyo's stints in the pink jersey and Tom Stamsnijder's win in the Traguardo Volante classification meant that they did not come away from the Giro empty-handed. Only , , , , and  came away from the Giro with nothing, even though Milram had one of their riders (Paul Voss) wearing the Mountains jersey at some point.\n\nParagraph 6: Possibly being one of the most famous physicians of the 17th and 18th centuries, Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738) approached phenomena in medicine with a scientific process of observation and experiments. He is most famous for recreating the Andrea Vesalius book of human anatomy. Boerhaave featured human beings participating in daily activities but with a transparency to them so that their organs could be seen. His fascination with chemistry led him to model the human body in terms of its chemistry in the flows and interactions of the different phases including solids, liquids and gases. In his work, he narrowed down the causes of diseases to a substance called \"acid humour,\" which would affect flow of blood causing unbalance and detrimental chemical reactions, eventually causing malfunctioning of the human body. In a different example, it is documented that Boerhaave observed a certain \"medullary oil\" existed inside of bones which was very important for creating the \"heat and vital motion\" disturbances that could lead to an ill state of the body. A certain accumulation of a fluid in these joints of the body would lead to disastrous stagnancy which would be characterized eventually by gangrenous or unhealthy tissue where this occurred. This medical state was coined as \"imposthumation.\" Boerhaave is, perhaps, most well known in the realm of iatrochemistry for his discussions and understanding of the nervous system. Historians believe that Boerhaave's understanding of the human body and mechanisms in relation to the nervous and physical anatomy came from his personal interactions with soldiers in wars between the Dutch and Spanish. Through his understanding of the human body and chemistry he was able to develop a medicine for physical injuries.  Boerhaave attributed fevers to the body's response to a stressful situation or shock, similar to the way that chemical reactions produce heat, in which the body encountered an unexpected onset of heat or freezing temperatures.\n\nParagraph 7: The MSC is a registered charity  and non-profit organisation  and depends on various sources of funding. From 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, the MSC's total income was £15 million. Total expenditure for the same period was £12 million. The MSC Board recognises it as generally good practice to hold reserves as a protection against any financial difficulties in the future. A reserves target of 6 to 9 months’ cover is considered to be necessary, at least as an aspiration, given the MSC's absence of a subscribing membership and uncertainty, as a market-based program, of its various income streams.\n\nParagraph 8: The Wonders of the East is found in three manuscripts. It is in the Beowulf manuscript (also known as the Nowell Codex, London, British Library, Cotton Vitellius A. xv). It is written in Late West Saxon in a Mercian dialect. Other than Beowulf and The Wonders of the East, the other works in this codex include: The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, and Judith. One scribe is believed to have copied The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, The Wonders of the East, and first part of Beowulf, and another scribe wrote the remainder of Beowulf and Judith. While the first scribe, known as Scribe A used a more traditional square insular minuscule script, Scribe B uses a newer, round minuscule script. This has made it quite difficult to date the codex, as both scripts originate from slightly different periods of Anglo-Saxon society. The date of this manuscript is usually believed to be “within a couple of decades of A.D. 1000,” argued to be no earlier than AD 997 and no later than AD 1016, although other scholars have dated it to be from as early as the 8th century. The earliest known owner of the codex was antiquarian Laurence Nowell, who left his signature in the top margin of several pages from the manuscript. The manuscript is heavily damaged from the fire of Cotton Library in 1731 and so some parts of accompanying texts are missing. The codex may have been intentionally put together because four of the manuscripts discuss monsters. Furthermore, it is a “liber monstrorum, or book of marvels, designed for entertainment along with usual edification. Andy Orchard argues the monsters witnessed in The Wonders of the East are identifiable in other texts of the manuscript. The \"Donestre\", cannibal creatures who lure \"foreigners\" in with \"devious words\" before eating all but their heads. These monsters sit and \"weep over the head\", which scholars such as Orchard have used to show how the creature resembles Grendel's Mother from Beowulf. Orchard further argues that these monsters reflect those who do not conform to Anglo-Saxon norms, and are a construction of the \"other\". Christopher Monk discusses theories focused on the sexuality and femininity of the monsters found in The Wonders of the East. He claims these monsters are depictions of human sexuality, aided by the illuminations which accompany the prose. The Wonders of the East is the only text from the Nowell Codex to be illustrated or \"illuminated\" which some highlight as central to the monster studies applied to the manuscript. Orchard argues that the text is a \"liber monstorum\" or \"book of monsters\" and illustrations aid the reader in studying the creatures described in the prose. Other creatures encountered include the snakes, which may stand for dragon. These creatures are said to have \"horns as large as rams\" and anyone who \"strikes them or touches them\" will die and the area around them \"set ablaze\". Another creature called a \"conopenae\", said to have the head of a dog which some scholars have argued links with Saint Christopher from an earlier text, who may have had the head of a dog according to legend.\n\nParagraph 9: No Wo ambassador, for example, came to China during the second century. This interval continued well past the third century. Then within merely nine years, the female Wo ruler Himiko sent four ambassadors to the Wei court (220-265) in 238, 243, 245, and 247, respectively. After the death of Himiko, diplomatic contact with China slowed. Iyoo, the female successor to Himiko, contacted the Wei court only once. The fourth century was another quiet period in China-Wo relations except for the Wo delegation dispatched to the Western Jin court (265-316) in 306. With the arrival of a Wo ambassador at the Eastern Jin court (317-420) in 413, a new age of frequent diplomatic contact with China began. Over the next sixty years, ten Wo ambassadors called on the Southern Song court (420-479), and a Wo delegation also visited the Southern Qi court (479-502) in 479. The sixth century saw only one Wo ambassador pay respect to the Southern Liang court (502-557) in 502. When these ambassadors arrived in China, they acquired official titles, bronze mirrors, and military banners, which their masters could use to bolster their claims to political supremacy, to build a military system, and to exert influence on southern Korea.

Nicholai then betrays and locks Jill and Mikhail out, with the latter sacrificing himself by detonating an explosive that derails the train. Meanwhile, reaching the police department on the notion that Bard is at the S.T.A.R.S. office, Carlos and Tyrell learn the scientist took refuge at a nearby hospital. Carlos is then contacted by Jill, who survived the crash while being pursued by a mutating Nemesis. She manages to escape Nemesis, only to lose consciousness after the monster infects her with the T-virus. Carlos finds Jill half a day later and takes her to the hospital, finding Bard murdered along with the scientist's video entry revealing that Umbrella's board is wiping out the vaccines and any evidence connecting the company to the T-Virus. After Carlos retrieves Bard's vaccine and administers it to Jill, Tyrell discovers that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-virus infestation. Carlos travels to a lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to prevent the missile strike. "}

The protagonist, identified only as \"he,\" clashes with Camille Chautemps, criticizing him for defeatism and praising the spirit of French soldiers from World War I. He then speaks with Roland de Margerie, expressing concern about several hundred German pilots who are prisoners of the French and requesting that they be handed over to the British. However, there is confusion and difficulty with communication. The protagonist also expresses misgivings about Reynaud's determination to continue the war, particularly in French North Africa. He is outraged that the French Commander in Chief in North Africa opposes receiving troops from France and believes it is monstrous that Reynaud doesn't dismiss him. The protagonist questions why the idea of forming a redoubt in Brittany was dropped and why Reynaud doesn't dismiss General Weygand for defeatist views. He doubts that America will join the war and sends a telegram to London explaining the situation, expressing little confidence in anything. The protagonist learns that Marshal Pétain will resign if American help doesn't come, and concludes that Reynaud won't continue in the face of opposition from the Marshal and Weygand.

Sidi Mohammed then marched with an army to Fes where he defeated the Wadaya contingents and arrested their leaders. After this, the Wadaya were split up and were garrisoned in Meknes instead. Later in 1775, he tried to distance the 'Abid al-Bukhari from power by ordering their transfer from Meknes to Tangier in the north. The 'Abid resisted him and attempted to proclaim his son Yazid as sultan, but the latter soon changed his mind and was reconciled with his father. After, Sidi Mohammed dispersed the 'Abid contingents to garrisons in Tangier, Larache, Rabat, Marrakesh and the Sus, where they continued to cause trouble until 1782. These disturbances were compounded by drought and severe famine between 1776 and 1782 and an outbreak of plague between 1779 and 1780, which killed many Moroccans and forced the sultan to import wheat, reduce taxes, and distribute food and funds to locals and tribal leaders in order to alleviate the suffering. By now, however, the improved authority of the sultan allowed the central government to weather these difficulties and crises. He was interested in scholarly pursuits and also cultivated a productive relationship with the ulama, or Muslim religious scholars, who supported some of his initiatives and reforms.\n\nParagraph 2: In consequence, most wives and mothers of several Ottoman Sultans were ethnic Circassians, including Perestü Valide Sultan, Şevkefza Valide Sultan, Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan, Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi, Şemsiruhsar Hatun, Saçbağlı Sultan, Hümaşah Haseki Sultan, Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan, Ayşe Haseki Sultan, Bedrifelek I, Bidar II, Kamures I, Servetseza I, Bezmara VI, Düzdidil III, Hayranıdil II, Meyliservet IV, Mihrengiz II, Neşerek III, Nurefsun II, Reftaridil II, Şayan III, amongst many others. İkbals (honoured lady consorts) of Circassian descent were also numerous, most notable of them being Cevherriz II, Ceylanyar II, Dilfirib I, Nalanıdil III, and Nergis IV in addition to Gözdes (favourite lady consorts), including Dürdane I, Hüsnicenan III, Safderun IV, amongst others. The \"golden age\" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the Crimean Khanate and cut off their slave trade, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians massacred thousands of Circassians and conquered Circassia. After 1854, almost all Ottoman harem concubines were of Circassian origin; the Circassians had been expelled from Russian lands in the 1860s and the improverished refugee parents sold their daughters in a trade that was formally banned, but tolerated.\n\nParagraph 3: Stone and his sister Gina Williams were raised by their older brother Jagger Cates after their parents abandoned them. Jagger wasn't able to take care of them and they became separated and entered the foster parent rut. Stone met Karen Wexler at a party. Someone slipped something into her drink and Stone helped her. Stone did not know that she was dating his older brother Jagger. Karen felt she wasn't good enough for Jagger so she ended their relationship. Stone was living with Sonny Corinthos. Sonny was seeing Karen and got her hooked on drugs. Jagger found his little brother at his girlfriend Krystal's grave site and they began to build a relationship. Jagger became a cop and became engaged to Karen. Jagger saved his brother when he was supposed to drive the get away car to break Frank Smith out of prison. Jagger had a motorcycle accident but recovered and married Karen. Stone started to date Robin Scorpio. The pair fell deeply in love. Mac Scorpio, Robin's uncle, proved to be a big obstacle in their relationship as he did not approve of his niece dating a street kid. He came down with the flu and Robin took care of him. He told her that he had been tested for HIV and they had sex for the first time. They used protection at first, but eventually they stopped; this was a decision that would change Robin's life forever. Stone had the flu for a while and decided to get tested for HIV again. The test came back positive. He did not know how to tell Robin. Stone was shot and his blood got on Robin. He ran away from her. She found him in the same motel where they previously had sex. Stone told Robin that he was HIV positive. Dr. Alan Quartermaine ordered that they both be tested. Stone's test revealed that he now had AIDS. Robin's test came back negative. Alan started Stone on drug therapy. Mac Scorpio, Robin's uncle was furious when he found out, but he cared for Stone and even saved his life during a seizure, and later bonded with the kid. Robin later tested positive for HIV. Towards the end of his life, Stone was cared for by Robin and Sonny Corinthos at Sonny's penthouse. Stone's eyesight started to fail due to CMV retinitis worsened by his illness. Right before he died he was able to focus on Robin and see her for one last time. His last word were, \"I see you...Oh, Robin, I see you.\" Stone was like a brother to Sonny and Sonny took his death very hard. Brenda Barrett took his death hard as well, and the two comforted each other.

In the sixth inning, after a one-out walk and single, Gordon's RBI single made it 3–1 Yankees. After a single and error, pinch-hitter Lew Riggs' single scored Cookie Lavagetto in the seventh inning as the Dodgers pulled to within 3–2. Then they threatened in the ninth inning with hits by Joe Medwick and Pee Wee Reese, before Ruffing was able to get Herman Franks to ground into a game-ending 4-6-3 double play.\n\nParagraph 5: One of the Committee's more memorable activities was a protest Kook organized known as the Rabbis' march. The protest took place in Washington, D.C. on October 6, 1943, three days before Yom Kippur. Joined by Bergson Group activists, the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America marched on the United States Capitol, Lincoln Memorial, and White House in Washington, DC. They were met by a number of prominent members of Congress including William Warren Barbour, the protesters plead for U.S. intervention on behalf of the Jews in Europe. The delegation was received by Vice President Henry Wallace. Disappointed by the President's failure to meet with them, the rabbis stood in front of the US Capitol, where they were met by Senator William Barbour and other members of Congress. They refused to read their petition aloud, instead handing it to the Presidential secretary, Marvin H. McIntyre. The march garnered much media attention, much of it focused on what was seen as the cold and insulting dismissal of many important community leaders, as well as the people in Europe they were fighting for. One Jewish newspaper commented, \"Would a similar delegation of 500 Catholic priests have been thus treated?\"  Years later, Rabbi Soloveitchik, in recorded lectures, would bemoan the betrayal of the Rabbis' mission by Stephen Wise, who dismissed them as a group of Orthodox rabbis who didn't represent anyone. A week later, Senator William Warren Barbour (R; New Jersey), one of a handful of politicians who met with the rabbis on the steps of the US Capitol, proposed legislation that would have allowed as many as 100,000 victims of the Holocaust to emigrate temporarily to the United States. A parallel bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Samuel Dickstein (D; New York). This also failed to pass.\n\nParagraph 6: For the Falcons home opener the 1–0 St. Louis Rams came to the Georgia Dome to take on the 1–0 Falcons. The Falcons started their second drive of the game from their own 18-yard line when Michael Vick dumped a pass off to his full back Justin Griffith. Griffith took the ball all the way to the St. Louis 20 for a 62-yard gain. 4 plays later Vick found Griffith again this time for a 3-yard touchdown pass to give the Falcons the lead 7 to 0. In the second quarter Vick set up the Falcons second score of the game, with a 14-yard run to the St. Louis 2-yard line. Vick's run was followed by Warrick Dunn scoring the Falcons second touchdown of the game. After Jay Feely’s extra point the Falcons had the lead 14 to 0. On the following drive the Rams’ offence moved the ball 82 yards to the Falcon's 1-yard line where Marshall Faulk capped of the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Vick and the Falcons got the ball back with 1:06 left before half time. Vick's 3 rushes on the drive for 20, 14, and 18 yards put Falcons kicker Jay Feely in range for a 35-yard field goal with 6 seconds left in the half. The Falcon's went into half time with a 10-point lead. In the third quarter Ram's QB Marc Bulger completed 4 of 5 passes as he moved the ball down the field on an 80-yard touchdown drive. The drive was capped off with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt, which cut the Falcons lead 3 points. Later in the third quarter the rams tied when Jeff Wilkins hit a 46-yard field goal to make the score 17 to 17. On the next drive Vick completed 3 of his 4 pass attempts for 48 yards. He then set up another Warrick Dunn 2-yard touchdown run with a 7-yard rush from the St. Louis 9-yard line. Because of a taunting penalty on the kick off the rams started their ensuing drive on their own 10-yard line. On first down Patrick Kerney sacked Ram's QB Marc Bulger at the St. Louis 1-yard line. Backed up at their own 1-yard line Bulger and the Rams wanted to try to make a big play (after the game Bulger said \"I was going for a home run,\"). When Bulger dropped back to pass in his own end zone Falcon's defensive end Brady Smith got into the back field, and took the ball right from Bulger's hand for a touchdown. Bulger almost got the pass off for what could have been a 99-yard touchdown for the Rams. \"I was a half-second away from letting the ball go. ... It could have been a touchdown the other way.\" Said Bulger after the game. The Falcons kicked one more field goal before the game ended to make the final score Falcons 34, Rams 17. . For the third time in his career Vick ran for more than 100 yards in a game; he finished the game with 109. For the second week in a row Warrick Dunn ran for 2 touchdowns .\n\nParagraph 7: The next day he clashed with Camille Chautemps, Vice-President of the cabinet, upbraiding him for his defeatism and praising the spirit of the French soldiers that he had known during the First World War. He later spoke to Roland de Margerie, Reynaud's Chef de cabinet and raised the matter of several hundred German pilots who were prisoners of the French, asking that they be handed over to the British. However, there was much confusion and telephone communications were difficult even within the city of Bordeaux itself. Spears now had misgivings about Reynaud's determination to stay in the war, if necessary from French North Africa. He was outraged that despite the critical situation, the French Commander in Chief in North Africa was opposed to receiving troops from France. There was insufficient accommodation, no spare weapons, there was a shortage of doctors; moreover the climate was rather warm for young Frenchmen at this season! In Spears' view this was monstrous; why did Reynaud not dismiss the obstructionist general? He asked why the idea of forming a redoubt in Brittany had been dropped and why Reynaud did not dismiss General Weygand for his defeatism. Margerie replied that the people had faith in Weygand and that he also had the support of Pétain. Continuing in the same vein, Spears poured cold water on the notion that America might join the war. Spears and the ambassador sent a telegram to London explaining that everything now hung on an assurance from the US, adding that they would to their utmost to obtain the scuttling of the French fleet. Their final words were, \"We have little confidence in anything now.\" They heard that Marshal Pétain would resign if American help was not forthcoming; Spears concluded that Reynaud would not continue in the face of combined opposition from the Marshal and Weygand. He longed for the presence of Churchill, which would have been 'worth more than millions in gold could buy'.\n\nParagraph 8: This chapter discusses \"race-contact\", specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise.  As for physical proximity, Du Bois states there is an obvious \"physical color-line\" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country.  He says that here is a need for \"Negro leaders of character and intelligence\" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation.  The power of the ballot is necessary, he asserts, as \"in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected.\"  He says that \"the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves,\" and Negroes viewed its \"courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks.\"  Regarding social contact, Du Bois states \"there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other.\"  He concludes that \"the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position.\"\n\nParagraph 9: OCA theory has been most frequently applied to discussions of the euro and the European Union. Many have argued that the EU did not actually meet the criteria for an OCA at the time the euro was adopted, and attribute the Eurozone's economic difficulties in part to continued failure to do so.  Europe does indeed score well on some of the measures characterising an OCA (such as symmetry of shocks).  Poloz (1990) concluded that a European Monetary Union should be viable since the variability of real exchange rates in Europe was similar to that between Canadian regions.This work was cited by the European Commission itself in the 1990 report One Market, One Money. By looking at the correlation of a region's GDP growth rate with that of the entire zone, the Eurozone countries show slightly greater correlations compared to the U.S. states. However, it has lower labour mobility than the United States, possibly due to language and cultural differences. In O'Rourke's paper, more than 40% of U.S. residents were born outside the state in which they live. In the Eurozone, only 14% people were born in a different country than the one in which they live. In fact, the U.S. economy was approaching a single labor market in the nineteenth century. However, for most parts of the Eurozone, such levels of labour mobility and labor market integration remain a distant prospect. Furthermore, the U.S. economy, with a central federal fiscal authority, has stabilization transfers. When a state in the U.S. is in recession, every $1 drop in that state’s GDP would have an offsetting transfer of 28 cents. Such stabilizing transfers are not present in both the Eurozone and EU; thus, they cannot rely on fiscal federalism to smooth out regional economic disturbances. The European crisis, however, may be pushing the EU towards more federal powers in fiscal policy.\n\nParagraph 10: In 416, Yao Xing went to the vacation palace at Huayin (), and he had Yao Hong formally serve as regent at Chang'an and stay in the palace.  Yao Xing grew gravely ill at Huayin, however, and was on the way back to Chang'an when his attendant Yin Chong (), a conspirator with Yao Bi, planned to assassinate Yao Hong when he comes out of the palace to welcome his father.  Yao Hong's associates, however, heard rumors of the plot and persuaded him not to come out of the palace.  Yin Chong's assistant Yao Shami () then suggested to Yin that they deliver Yao Xing to Yao Bi's home and start a rebellion there, but Yin hesitated and did not carry this suggestion out.  As soon as Yao Xing returned to the palace, he ordered that Yao Bi's home be searched and that all weapons be seized.  When Yao Yin () the Duke of Nanyang, another brother who was in alliance with Yao Bi, then attacked the palace with Yin Chong, planning to put Yao Bi on the throne, Yao Xing publicly ordered that Yao Bi be forced to commit suicide, causing Yao Yin's force to collapse.  The next day, Yao Xing, after entrusting Yao Hong to his brother Yao Shao () the Duke of Dongping, Liang Xi, Yin Zhao, and Lian Manwei (), died.  Yao Hong initially did not announce news of Yao Xing's death, but did so only after executing Yao Yin and Yao Bi's other associates—including Lü Long the Duke of Jiankang and the former prince of Later Liang, and Yin Yuan ().  Yao Hong then took the throne and, not using the secondary imperial title that his father had used (\"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang)), directly claimed imperial title."}

Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1 (1977) and Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753 (1979). In those cases the authorities had first observed containers suspected of containing marijuana outside of a vehicle, where a warrant would be required to search them, and had waited until they were carried into a vehicle, at which point officers took advantage of the \"automobile exception\" to search the containers inside the vehicle. In those cases, the court found that those searches were unconstitutional because the police did not have probable cause to search the vehicles, but rather just the suspect containers which had been placed inside, and they did not have the warrant required to search the containers. Since the police had probable cause to suspect the containers before they came near an automobile, the relationship between the containers and the vehicles were purely coincidental. Since the police did not have probable cause to search the vehicle, they could not take advantage of the \"automobile exception\" to perform a warrantless search of the containers. From Arkansas v. Sanders:\n\nParagraph 2: Dominican Vodou is composed of three divisions, the Indian Division, which refers to Taino entities, the Black Division, whose entities are of African origin, and the White Division, whose entities are of European origin. The Indian Division is one of the main features that distinguishes 21 Divisiones from other forms of Vodou. Dominican Vodou uses a different percussion, a lot of times it is played with Abates or \"Tambour de Palo\", which are of Kongo origin; along with it a Guira (Scraper) is usually used. The drums are known as Palos and the drummers as Paleros, and when a ceremony in which they are at is usually referred to as a Fiesta de Palo. Dominican Vodou is practiced through a Tcha Tcha lineage (\"maraca\" – which means rattle – lineage). In Haiti, Vodou has come about and become more popular through another lineage known as the Asson. However, before the Asson, the Tcha Tcha lineage was the prominent lineage in Haiti. Thus the Tcha Tcha lineage is one of the oldest lineages within the Vodou tradition. Las 21 Divisiones is less strict than the Haitian Vodou tradition.   There is less regleman (fixed doctrines or rules) within the Haitian Vodou Tradition. There is no fixed doctrine, defined temples or ceremonies, and it does not have as rigid a structure. This can be seen in the many different ways in which Caballos de Misterios conduct ceremonies and how the spirits mount a person. Dominican Vodou practitioners are often called \"Caballos\" but they are also known as Papa Bokos and Papa Lwa (both for males) and Mama Mambos and Mama Lwa (both for females). One who has obtained this title has gone through the last and highest level of initiation that can take anywhere between 3 and 9 days and nights as well as have spent a time working for the community.\n\nParagraph 3: \"Diversity marketing involves acknowledging that marketing and advertising must offer alternative ways of communicating to these diverse groups. With that knowledge, diversity marketers aim to develop a mix of different communication methods, in order to reach people in each of the diverse groups present in the market\" Thus diversity marketing is the process in which companies study the market they are in or about to enter by different mean(e.g. surveys, focus groups or in some cases telecommunication). Diversity marketing is helping business owners and operators in all levels to connect with society through communication channels that best reach them, this creates exposure for the company which creates brand awareness. Diversity marketing realizes the markets vast differences and the market/consumers have different tastes may it be values, beliefs, interaction type and lifestyle choices. Such vast differences are then tackled by customized marketing strategies\n\nParagraph 4: The simplicity and convenience of calculating PEG leaves out several important variables. First, the absolute company growth rate used in the PEG does not account for the overall growth rate of the economy, and hence an investor must compare a stock's PEG to average PEG's across its industry and the entire economy to get any accurate sense of how competitive a stock is for investment. A low (attractive) PEG in times of high growth in the entire economy may not be particularly impressive when compared to other stocks, and vice versa for high PEG's in periods of slow growth or recession.\n\nParagraph 5: Mike Masnick of Techdirt wrote that World Intellectual Property Day is intended \"to promote ever greater protectionism and mercantilism in favor of copyright holders and patent holders, while ignoring any impact on the public of those things. It's a fairly disgusting distortion of the claimed intent of intellectual property.\" Zak Rogoff of the Defective by Design noted that it is a \"global but decidedly not grassroots event\". It has also been criticized by activists from civil society organizations such as IP Justice and the Electronic Information for Libraries who consider it one-sided propaganda as the marketing materials associated with the event, provided by WIPO, \"come across as unrepresentative of other views and events\". Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, noted that \"World Intellectual Property Day has become little more than a lobbyist day\". Cushla Kapitzk from the Queensland University of Technology wrote that most of the WIPO's statements related to promotion of the World Intellectual Property Day are \"either exaggerated or unsubstantiated\"; noting that for example one of WIPO's claims used to promote this event, namely that \"copyright helps bring music to our ears and art, films and literature before our eyes\" is \"tenuous at best, and lexical association of copyright with things recognised as having social and cultural value ('art', 'film' and 'literature') functions to legitimate its formulation and widespread application\".\n\nParagraph 6: Intercom systems are widely used in TV stations and outside broadcast vehicles such as those seen at sporting events or entertainment venues. There are essentially two different types of intercoms used in the television world: two-wire party line or four-wire matrix systems. In the beginning, TV stations would simply build their own communication systems using old phone equipment. However, today there are several manufacturers offering off-the-shelf systems. From the late 1970s until the mid-90s, the two-wire party line-type systems were the most popular, primarily due to the technology that was available at the time. The two-channel variety used a 32-volt impedance-generating central power supply to drive external stations or belt packs. This type of format allowed the two channels to operate in standard microphone cable, a feature highly desired by the broadcasters. These systems were very robust and simple to design, maintain and operate but had limited capacity and flexibility as they were usually hardwired. A typical user on the system could not choose whom to talk to. He would communicate with the same person or group of people until the system was manually reconfigured to allow communication with a different group of people. Two-wire routers or source assignment panels were then implemented to allow quick re-routing. This reconfiguration was usually handled at a central location, but because voltage is used on the circuit to power the external user stations as well as communicate, there would usually be a pop when the channels were switched.  So while one could change the system on-the-fly, it was usually not desirable to do so in the middle of a production, as the popping noise would distract the rest of the television crew.\n\nParagraph 7: In 2004, she débuted in Telugu cinema with M S Raju's romantic action film Varsham, which turned her into an overnight sensation. Critics lauded her performance as Sailaja, a middle-class girl who becomes a film star on her father's insistence; Jeevi from Idlebrain claimed that she was \"beautiful\" and a \"big plus to the film\", labelling her performance as \"natural\", while Sify noted that she had \"transformed herself into a fine actress with immense screen presence\". A critic from fullhyderabad.com praised her, citing that she had shown why Tamil Nadu was \"busy building her a temple\", further adding that she looked \"so fresh and fine, you feel like gifting her to the roses\". While the film was a major commercial success, running for over 175 days theatres, being declared a \"sensational hit\" and becoming one of the highest-grossers of the year, Trisha won her first Filmfare Awards for Best Actress – Telugu, as well as the Santosham Award for Best Actress. She was also offered the same role in its Tamil remake Mazhai, which she however declined. Later that year, she enacted the female lead opposite Vijay in the action comedy film Ghilli. She played the character of Dhanalakshmi, a helpless girl, whom a Kabaddi player tries to save from the clutches of an influential thug, who wants to marry her, with most critics agreeing that her performance was overshadowed by Vijay, and Prakash Raj's in particular. The film eventually emerged the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year, celebrating a 175-days-run, too, and remains Trisha's biggest commercial success at the time. She next appeared in a small role in Mani Ratnam's political drama Aayutha Ezhuthu, starring as part of an ensemble cast that included Siddharth, Madhavan and Surya. The film, despite favourable reviews, performed poorly at the box office, while she was again outshone by the three lead male actors.\n\nParagraph 8: The girls' field hockey team won the North Jersey II Group II state sectional championships in 1990, 2001, 2003–2005, 2007, and 2015; won the North II Group I titles in 1994, 1997, 2016, and 2017; won the North I Group I titles in 1995, 2000 and 2006; and won the North I Group II sectional titles in 2009 and 2014. The team won the Group I state championship in 1995, and the Group II titles in 1997, 2003, 2009, and 2015. The program's five state titles are tied for ninth-most in the state. The 1997 team finished the season with a 21–0–3 record after finishing the season by winning the Group I state title by defeating Haddonfield Memorial High School by a score of 2–0 in the championship game. In 2003, the field hockey team won the Group II state championship with a 5–1 win over Pequannock Township High School in the semifinals and a 2–1 win against Allentown High School in the tournament's final match. In 2007, the field hockey team won the North II, Group II state sectional championship with a 4–2 win over Hackettstown High School (which like Madison, is now part of the new Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference) in the tournament final. In 2009, the field hockey team finished the season ranked 4th in the state by The Star-Ledger, having won the North II, Group II state sectional championship, the Morris County Championship (for the 4th consecutive year), the NJAC Conference Championship, and, most notably, the Group II state championship with a 3–1 win against Bishop Eustace Preparatory School. In 2015, under coach Ann Marie Davies, the field hockey team won the NJAC title, Morris County Tournament, North II Group II state sectional title, and the Group II state title with a 5–0 win against Wall High School. The field hockey team won the 2015 Morris County Tournament with a 2–1 win against West Morris Mendham High School in the tournament final, winning the team's fifth consecutive county title and their 21st overall.\n\nParagraph 9: In a hard fought match that went the distance, Tyson ultimately picked up the victory via unanimous decision with all three judges ruling in his favor with one score of 113–109 and two scores of 114–108. Tyson got off to a strong start in round 1. With 16 seconds left in the round, Tyson staggered Ruddock with a right hook to the side of his head, causing Ruddock to hold on to Tyson to prevent taking any more damage. After the bell rang, Tyson threw two punches at Ruddock, who in turn responded with a powerful right hand that just missed connecting with Tyson. Referee Mills Lane warned the two fighters between rounds that he would deduct points should punches be thrown after the bell. Tyson continued to attack Ruddock in round 2, hitting him with another strong right hand in the round's opening seconds. Later in the round, Tyson hit Ruddock with a 3-punch combination as Ruddock was against the ropes, though one of the punches was below the belt, causing Lane to separate the two and issue a warning to Tyson. After Lane's warning, Tyson hit Ruddock with a strong right overhand that knocked Ruddock to the canvas. Ruddock almost immediately got back up but was met with a furious onslaught from Tyson, who continued to hammer Ruddock with punches until fatigue set in with about 30 seconds left in the round.  Ruddock bounced back with a strong round 3, but in round 4, Tyson countered a Ruddock uppercut and landed a right hook that again sent Ruddock to canvas, though Ruddock was again able to quickly get back to his feet. Tyson also had the first of three points deducted in round 4 after once again landing a low blow on Ruddock. Tyson also lost points in both the 9th and 10th rounds for hitting Ruddock with another low blow and hitting him after the bell, while Ruddock lost a point in the 8th for hitting Tyson after the bell. In round 11, the two fighters exchanged low blows, but Lane opted not to deduct points, instead warning the two to \"knock that shit off\". In round 12, Tyson fought Ruddock aggressively in an attempt to gain the knockout victory, but Ruddock was able to withstand Tyson's attack and survive the fight without any further knockdowns. By the end of the fight, Ruddock's left eye had been swollen shut and his jaw had been broken, while Tyson suffered a perforated eardrum.\n\nParagraph 10: Traditionally, students were required to be members of the nation corresponding to the area from which they came. With one exception, Södermanland-Nerikes nation at Uppsala, this requirement is now voided, and students may even join more than one nation. International students are also free to choose whichever nation they desire. The nations are in charge of the sorts of social activities and venues that at other universities are handled by the student unions, fraternities, or companies: bars, clubs, theatre companies, orchestras, sports societies, and also some housing. Nations notably host gasques, themed dinner parties that are a traditional part of Swedish student life."}
{"queries": ["The Faye family has a long history in the Serer country dating back to the 14th century. They gained prominence when Boukar Djillakh Faye, a professional wrestler, married a Guelowar princess and became the patriarch of the family. They had several children who became rulers of Sine, including Tasse Faye and Waagaan Tening Jom Faye. The Faye family has a family anthem and their totem is the African warthog. They were dominant in Sine during the Guelowar dynastic period but were eventually surpassed by the Joof family. However, the two families formed alliances when faced with common enemies, such as during the threat of jihad in Sine. The alliance between Diessanou Faye and Boureh Gnilane Joof led to victory, and Boureh Gnilane was made prime minister and married Diessanou Faye's sister.", "The text discusses different viewpoints regarding the identity and role of Borna, a historical figure in Croatia. R. Novaković argues that Borna was not a duke of Dalmatian Croatia, but rather a duke under Frankish rule in the western region. He suggests that Borna may have been the duke of an area not yet part of Croatia in the 9th century. M. Atlagić and B. Milutinović view Borna as a Dalmatian Slavic ruler. Another viewpoint suggests that Borna may have moved with a group of Timociani settlers to Slavonia. S. Prvanović suggests that Borna was a duke from the Timok-Kučevo region who founded the first Croatian state. M. S. Milojević treats Borna as a Frankish vassal in \"Littoral Croatia\", with holdings in the Timok region. Prvanović also accuses F. Racki of falsifying historical records and suggests that Borna was the duke of Guduscani and Timociani. Other scholars such as P. J. Šafárik and V.

He established his reputation as a composer with his publication of a book of madrigals in Venice in 1546, and in 1551 he took part in one of the most famous events in 16th century music theory, the debate between Vicente Lusitano and himself in Rome in 1551. The topic of the debate was the relationship of the ancient Greek genera to contemporary music practice, in particular whether contemporary music could be explained in terms of the diatonic genus alone (as Lusitano claimed) or (as Vicentino claimed) was best described as a combination of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, the last of which contained a microtone. The debate was rather unlike those among contemporary musicologists, being more like a refereed prize fight, with a panel of judges; they awarded the prize to Lusitano. In 1555 Vicentino published an account of the debate that was recognised as misleading at the time, but nevertheless went on to influence later composers.\n\nParagraph 2: Although the city of Kent incorporated in 1867 and the village of Brady Lake would follow in 1927, until 1993, the U.S. Census Bureau counted most of the population of Kent and all of Brady Lake as the \"incorporated portions\" of Franklin Township.  As such, the township has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields, most of whom are more associated with Kent or Brady Lake.  John Davey, a pioneer in tree surgery and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company moved to Kent/Franklin Township in the 1880s.  His son, Martin L. Davey, would later serve as Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Representative.  Other political figures to come from Kent/Franklin Township include Wisconsin governor Lucius Fairchild, former U.S. Representative Robert E. Cook, and noted abolitionist John Brown, who lived in the township from 1835 to 1839. Noted athletes to have come from Kent/Franklin Township include former National Football League players Mike Adamle, Tom DeLeone, and Stan White and former Major League Baseball player, manager, and executive Gene Michael. Professional golfer Ben Curtis, a Kent State University alumnus, has been a resident of the township since 2011. Two members of the band Devo, which debuted in Kent in 1973 and was founded by Kent State University students, are natives of Kent/Franklin Township: Peter Gregg and Rod Reisman. Other performing artists to come from Kent/Franklin Township include singer Julianne Baird, playwright Vincent J. Cardinal, and voice actor Joshua Seth. Lucien Price, an author and writer for The Boston Evening Transcript and The Atlantic Monthly grew up in the area and used the pseudonym \"Woolwick\" for Kent in some of his stories. Kent/Franklin Township was also the home of inventor Lucien B. Smith, regarded as the inventor of barbed wire. Additionally, many notable people have lived in Kent/Franklin Township while attending Kent State University, among them comedians Drew Carey and Arsenio Hall, actor Michael Keaton, musician Joe Walsh, and additional members of the band Devo. Notable athletes include football player Jack Lambert; Major League Baseball players Thurman Munson and Rich Rollins; and college football coaches Nick Saban and Lou Holtz.\n\nParagraph 3: R. Novaković (1973) does not support that he was a duke of Dalmatian Croatia, as no contemporary sources name him as such. According to him, Borna could only be the duke of that area that was at the time under Frankish supreme rule, and that he was active only in the area included in the rebellion against Frankish rule, that is, only west of the Una river. It is possible that Borna was the duke of an archonty not yet part of Croatia in the beginning of the 9th century, neither was Croatia at all included in the events of Ljudevit's rebellion. The war was fought only in the area under Frankish rule, while Dalmatian Croatia was outside those events, as it at that time was under Byzantine supreme rule. M. Atlagić and B. Milutinović (2002) treat him as a Dalmatian Slavic ruler. Another view is that it seems that after the Timociani did not receive aid, a part of them settled in Slavonia, it seems also that Borna moved with them; S. Prvanović (1962) viewed him as a duke from Timok-Kučevo that founded the first Croatian state, while M. S. Milojević (1872) treated him as a Frankish vassal in \"Littoral Croatia\" that originally held three counties in the Timok region. Prvanović claimed that F. Racki had falsified the RFA, that Borna actually was the duke of Guduscani and Timociani, combined, and that Racki had put a comma after Guduscani, based on the identification with Gacka in Lika and presumption that due to the geographical distance between the two meant that the two could not have had nearer contact nor a joint duke. Prvanović was not the first to put the Guduscani in the Timok region; 19th-century P. J. Šafárik and V. Karić located them around the Timok and Danube.\n\nParagraph 4: Austria has a multi-party system. From 1945 to 1986, Austrian politics had a two-party system, where two main parties, the SPÖ on the center-left and the ÖVP on the center-right, generally dominated politics. However, a third party would sometimes also win seats in the National Council. From 1986 onward a multi-party system has evolved, with no one party having enough support to hold a majority of seats in parliament, and the resultant need for alliances and power-sharing in a series of coalition governments. The two most recent coalition governments --- ÖVP & SPÖ and ÖVP & FPÖ—both failed. Following the 2019 National Council elections, in which its former coalition partners suffered heavy losses, the victorious ÖVP is now negotiating with the Green Party to form a third variant of a two-party coalition government; one for which examples so far only exists at the state level.\n\nParagraph 5: McEwing was named manager of the Charlotte Knights, the White Sox Triple-A affiliate, for the 2011 season. In October 2011, McEwing was promoted to serve as the third base coach for the White Sox in 2012, serving under new manager Robin Ventura. Several managerial and coaching positions opened up shortly before the end of the 2011 season when then White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén announced that he would be leaving. McEwing was promoted from third base coach to bench coach for the 2017 season and continued to occupy that job until 2020 when the White Sox hired Miguel Cairo. On December 1, 2020, McEwing was named third base coach. \n\nParagraph 6: Ganey's departure from Belize was at the instigation of Sir Ronald Garvey KCMG, who had served in the Fiji Islands before coming to Belize and felt that Ganey could do wonders for Fiji with cooperatives and credit unions. He convinced the Jesuit superior to send Ganey to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Samoa, where he spent the rest of his life.  Ganey established the first credit union in Fiji in January 1954 and by July of the same year established the Credit Union Ordinance which later became the Fiji Credit Union Act, impacting also Tonga and Samoa where Ganey extended his work. He organised insurance underwriting for the Pacific credit unions through CUNA Mutual Group and developed the Bergengren Credit Union Training Centre in 1964, at the same time contributing to the formation of the South Pacific Association of Credit Union Leagues. Fiji, at its height, had a total of 39 credit unions with some 8,600 members. In 1961, Fr. Marion Ganey was invited to New Zealand to lead a seminar on the importance of a united credit union movement. Way before mobile banking became popular there was a mobile credit union, operating out the back of a landrover. The visit by Ganey and his executives was usually followed by feasting and celebrations. Ganey died in Fiji in 1984 and was gladly accorded his wish of being buried at the parish there. \"Every year we celebrate the day he died like we're celebrating the life of a saint,\" a villager said. Komave villagers from around the world returned to the village to celebrate the life of Fr. Ganey. \"At that time the whole village would come together to celebrate mass and also prepare a feast in his honour.\" He made Fiji his home and final resting place but only after he gained a place among them as a member of the Mataqali (clan) Waqanitabua.  He visited Belize in 1969 and spoke at the 25th anniversary of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union. And when in 1977 the bishop blessed a US$1,250,000 addition to the Northern Fishermen Cooperative building, Ganey was invited to speak. This was his final trip to Belize. Recounting this occasion, as well as his death seven years later, The Christian Herald wrote: \"The tall, lanky figure of Fr. Ganey was everywhere, advising, encouraging, giving of his talents to engineer the success of this economic effort that affected the root people.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Faran Thomason, who is best known as the producer of both Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales and Warlocked for the Game Boy Color, worked as a level designer and tester for the game. He stated that when the game was showcased in Atari Corp.'s US offices it was in a very basic state, consisting of only the ship flying and a rudimentary Gouraud-shaded terrain. The testing department at Atari was tasked to implement levels and structures in the game, while ATD laid down the terrain and enemies via a rudimentary editor the Atari testing team would use to implement them into the game. Cybermorph was first showcased at Atari's August 1993 press conference at Sunnyvale, California in an early but playable state. A 1993 promotional recording sent by Atari to video game retail stores features the game in a much earlier state with many differences compared to the final release. B.J. West, who worked as an animator in Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy, created both the cover art and ending sequence for the game. Sean Patter, producer of both Cybermorph and Iron Soldier, stated that by bringing the testing team to design game resulted in a lot of work but he remarked that by doing so resulted in making it into \"a much better game in the long run\". Several other members at Atari were also involved with its production.Cybermorph makes use of the various hardware features found within the Jaguar such as Z-buffering, which is used in multiple enemies of the game to various effects. In addition, Z-buffering is also used to handle drawing of all the objects and the planetary terrain. It also runs between 10-18 frames per second and displays around 6000 polygons on-screen. Gouraud shading is also used as a light source for all the polygon models, while the system's Motorola 68000 is used to move all of the objects in the game. The voice of Skylar was provided by Victoria Lowe, wife of video game composer David Lowe.Cybermorph was first released as the pack-in game for the Atari Jaguar when it launched on in North America on November 23, 1993. The game was later released in Europe on June 23, 1994, and finally in Japan as a stand-alone release on December 15 of the same year, where it was published by Mumin Corporation. Later versions of the game published in 1994 were stored on a one-megabyte cartridge and has several features missing from the original 1993 version such as the introduction and ending animation sequences, as well as additional voice samples. The cutting of these features in the one-megabyte version was a cost-effective measure Atari Corp. made in order to boost sales of the system, taking approximately two hours for the team to remove them in order to fit the game from a 2MB cart onto a 1MB cart. Fred Gill stated that \"whilst an interesting engineering exercise, it was painful ‘mutilating’ something that we'd crafted over such a long time\". It remained as a bundled title for the console. The game was included as part of the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One, marking its first re-release.\n\nParagraph 8: The early history of the Faye family goes back to Lamanic times, however they did not achieve particular fame and notoriety until the 14th century. The Faye family that had ruled the pre-colonial kingdoms of Sine trace descent to Boukar Djillakh Faye (variation: Bougar Birame Faye), an early 14th-century professional wrestler called njom in Serer and patriarch of this patriclan. In the early 14th century, Boukar Djillakh Faye was regarded as one of the best wrestlers in Serer country. The Guelowar princess Lingeer Tening Jom was given to him in marriage. Tening Jom was the niece of Maysa Wali who later became a Maad a Sinig (title for the king of Sine) — ruling from . From that marriage, they had several children including Tasse Faye (or Tassé Faye, the first from this family to rule Sine as Maad a Sinig during this era) and Waagaan Tening Jom Faye (the king with at least 24 children including 9 daughters) — one of the better known kings from this family. Dinned into Senegambian and Serer history, the Faye family, like their Joof counterparts are one of few Senegambian families that have a family anthem (boom). The name of their anthem is \"Waagaan Koumbassandiane\", (proper: Waagaan Kumbasaanjaan) who actually was a medieval king of Sine (Maad a Sinig Waagaan Kumbasaanjaan Faye) reported to be one of the longest reigning kings of Sine and ancestor of this family. This family's anthem forms part of the overture of the Epic of Sanmoon Faye, which relates the history and deeds of Maad a Sinig Sanmoon Faye, the controversial king of Sine who succeeded Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof in 1871. Their family totem is the African warthog (called \"ruul a koб\" in Serer, variation: \"ruul-a-koƥ\") — (previously grouped with the boar). In the early part of the Guelowar dynastic period (1350–1969), the Faye paternal dynasty was dominant in Sine, providing many of the Serer kings. However they were eventually overtaken by the Joof family who provided more kings of Sine, even from the 19th century to 1969. Notwithstanding the rivalries between these two patriclans, alliances were formed on certain occasions in order to repulse those they perceived as the greater enemy. One of these medieval alliances was between Maad a Sinig Diessanou Faye and Jaraff Boureh Gnilane Joof (founder of the Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof). That historical alliance was brought about when the Muslim marabout—Mohammadou of Koungo launched jihad in the Sine, threatening the survival of Serer religion in the country. Diessanou Faye, who was on the throne of Sine requested the assistance of the Joof family. Assistance was granted, with the Joof clan led by Boureh Gnilane Joof (son of the warlord king of Laah and conqueror of Baol - Maad Patar Kholleh Joof). The Joof—Faye alliance led to the defeat the Muslim army. For his part in achieving victory, Boureh Gnilane was made Jaraff (equivalent of prime minister) and given the sister of Diessanou Faye (Lingeer Gnilane Faye) in marriage.\n\nParagraph 9: The primary threat to Barry and WAMB became the passage of time, and Barry's original business model, once very profitable, would eventually become unsustainable.  Each year, a certain percentage of his targeted audience died and, for the most part, was not replaced by younger listeners, most of whom were either unfamiliar with the big-band genre or else disliked it due to its elderly image, as portrayed often in general American popular culture from the 1960s onward (see \"generation gap\" above).  In recognition of this fact and to compensate for it, some newer music from the \"easy-listening\" category of artists such as The Carpenters, Roger Whittaker, and Harry Connick, Jr. (favorite artists of some in the Baby Boom generation especially) was admitted to WAMB's playlist, but the station's demographics continued to skew far older than any other major Nashville station. This was becoming an increasing liability given the Nashville area's strong and steady population growth (which exploded around the time of the station's demise), bringing a much more competitive radio scene than when Barry started, thus making his position among advertisers more precarious than before. In particular, few of Nashville's newer residents were interested in the specialty programming WAMB featured; the overwhelming majority belonged to the key demographic of ages 18 to 49, a group Barry practically made a career of ignoring. In turn, young adults, except those who enjoyed talk radio or foreign-language formats (i.e., immigrants), usually ignored the AM dial of their radios anyway. All of these issues added up to little to no possibility of audience growth. In recognition of these realities, Barry decided to try to cut his losses, and he sold the 1160 kHz frequency in late 2005 to religious radio broadcaster Bott Communications. Bott took over the frequency in early 2006 and changed the format to a Christian one, with a standard emphasis on evangelical/fundamentalist preaching and conservative talk shows in keeping with the stringent ethics of those faiths.  To reflect the station's new identity and audience, Bott had the call sign of 1160 kHz changed to WCRT. Even after the sale, Barry opted to try again, by moving the big-band/adult standards format and WAMB callsign to a new frequency (with power greatly reduced, thereby less expensive), 1200 kHz. Later Barry acquired another FM frequency, 99.3, for simulcasting purposes, to air the station at night, when 1200 AM had to cease broadcasting (see above); this continued until shortly after his death.\n\nParagraph 10: The variant that is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago is known as Trinidadian Hindustani, Trinidadian Bhojpuri, Trinidadian Hindi, Indian, Plantation Hindustani, or Gaon ke Bolee (Village Speech). A majority of the early Indian indentured  immigrants spoke the Bhojpuri and Awadhi dialects, which later formed into Trinidadian Hindustani. In 1935, Indian movies began showing to audiences in Trinidad. Most of the Indian movies were in the Standard Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) dialect and this modified Trinidadian Hindustani slightly by adding Standard Hindi and Urdu phrases and vocabulary to Trinidadian Hindustani. Indian movies also revitalized Hindustani among Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians. The British colonial government and estate owners had disdain and contempt for Hindustani and Indian languages in Trinidad. Due to this, many Indians saw it as a broken language keeping them in poverty and bound to the cane fields, and did not pass it on as a first language, but rather as a heritage language, as they favored English as a way out. Around the mid to late 1960s the lingua franca of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians switched from Trinidadian Hindustani to a sort of Hindinized version of English. Today Hindustani survives on through Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian musical forms such as, Bhajan, Indian classical music, Indian folk music, Filmi, Pichakaree, Chutney, Chutney soca, and Chutney parang. As of 2003, there are about 15,633 Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians who speak Trinidadian Hindustani and as of 2011, there are about 10,000 who speak Standard Hindi. Many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians today speak a type of Hinglish that consists of Trinidadian and Tobagonian English that is heavily laced with Trinidadian Hindustani vocabulary and phrases and many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians can recite phrases or prayers in Hindustani today. There are many places in Trinidad and Tobago that have names of Hindustani origin. Some phrases and vocabulary have even made their way into the mainstream English and English Creole dialect of the country. World Hindi Day is celebrated each year on 10 January with events organized by the National Council of Indian Culture, Hindi Nidhi Foundation, Indian High Commission, Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Co-operation, and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha."}

We have made it clear that these crazy comments are not acceptable, and we hope he refrains from this talk and gets to work on General Assembly business.\" However, Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations, said: \"It's hard to make sense of Mr. D'Escoto's increasingly bizarre statements.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The earliest sauropterygians appeared about 247 million years ago (Ma), at the start of the Middle Triassic: the first definite sauropterygian with exact stratigraphic datum lies within the Spathian division of the Olenekian era in South China. Early examples were small (around 60 cm), semi-aquatic lizard-like animals with long limbs (pachypleurosaurs), but they quickly grew to be several metres long and spread into shallow waters (nothosaurs). The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event wiped them all out except for the plesiosaurs. During the Early Jurassic, these diversified quickly into both long-necked small-headed plesiosaurs proper, and short-necked large-headed pliosaurs. Originally, it was thought that plesiosaurs and pliosaurs were two distinct superfamilies that followed separate evolutionary paths. It now seems that these were simply morphotypes in that both types evolved a number of times, with some pliosaurs evolving from plesiosaur ancestors, and vice versa.\n\nParagraph 4: Lady Octopus appears as a member of a female incarnation of the Sinister Syndicate. She asks Francine Frye if she is familiar with the concept of macrobiotics. Carolyn then mentioned to Janice Lincoln about the e-mail about the refrigerator where there is dairy products inside where she was planning an organic vegan cheeseburger night on Friday. The Sinister Syndicate begins their mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at. Beetle leads the Sinister Syndicate in attacking Boomerang. It was stated by Boomerang that he was the one who came up with the Sinister Syndicate name. Lady Octopus stated that they dropped the \"Sinister\" part of the Sinister Syndicate's name. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang's gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang. When Beetle returns to the headquarters, Lady Octopus is present when Mayor Wilson Fisk brings the full force of New York City to their headquarters demanding that they surrender Boomerang to him. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. After Spider-Man evacuates Boomerang, the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.\n\nParagraph 5: Nevada Smith is a 1966 American Western film directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Steve McQueen, Karl Malden, Brian Keith, Arthur Kennedy and Suzanne Pleshette. The film was made by Embassy Pictures and Solar Productions, in association with and released by Paramount Pictures. The movie was a prequel to the 1961 Harold Robbins novel The Carpetbaggers, which had been made into a highly successful film two years earlier, with Alan Ladd playing McQueen's part as an older man. Nevada Smith depicts Smith's first meeting with another \"Carpetbaggers\" character, Jonas Cord Sr., and delves into Nevada Smith's background as summarized in a scene from the original film.\n\nParagraph 6: Religious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by Alan Race in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation and eternal paradise is contingent on one's belief in the core tenets of that religion. Diana Eck states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’. While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories inclusivism and pluralism. In his 1982 Christians and Religious Pluralism, Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value. While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.\n\nParagraph 7: Both men and women dance together, dressed in traditional costume. At the commencement of the dance, participants form two circles, the women, who form a small inner circle, are encompassed by men, who form a large circle around them, and They move first in clockwise then in anti-clockwise direction determining the rhythm of the dance by the beating together of sticks and striking of drums. As the dance proceeds, the participants change places, with men forming the inner circle. Sometimes, it is performed exclusively by men folk. At that time, a series of half-swirls make up a simpler version of the dance depending on the dancer`s ability & proficiency, it is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of sticks gives the dance a vigorous character & consistent tempo. Gair dances by Bhil folk are performed with wearing colourful dresses and carrying swords, arrows and sticks. It is the major attraction of people. There are many differences in the performance of men and women in this dance. The sticks used in the dance are called Khanda. It is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of the sticks gives the dance a vigorous character and a consistent tempo. When they are dancing it seems as if they are depicting a scene from war front. It is believed by the locals that this dance must have got some significance to war. This form of dance is also seen in Africa and Central Asia. These sticks are very attractive and catch every eye. The sticks play vital role in the dance. They are very thin and does not carry much of weight and give a flare look. These sticks are cut from the Gundi tree and involves little cleaning process. In some places instead of sticks swords are used .In one hand the dancers carries the naked sword and in the other hand is occupied with Khanda(a name of sword in Rajasthan) or the stick.  Apart from this Gair is also of third type in which the dancers carry sword in one hand and in the other hand they carry the wooden sword.\n\nParagraph 8: After Efuru’s first publication, it received mixed reviews. For instance, Kenyan author Grace Ogot spoke positively of the novel in a review which appeared in the East Africa Journal in 1966, stating that “of the many novels that are coming out of Nigeria, Efuru is one of the few that portrays vividly the woman's world, giving only peripheral treatment to the affairs of men.” Nwapa's male counterparts, however, were not as fond of the book. Literary critic Eldred Jones and author Eustace Palmer both represent the opinion of some Nigerian male writers at the time, most of whom criticize Nwapa for focusing on the affairs of women. Later critics of Efuru, however, commend Nwapa for creating an image of female protagonists unlike that created by Nigerian male writers. Author Rose Acholonu describes Nwapa and certain other African female writers as \"pathfinders\", who were able to \"break the seals of silence and invisibility on the female protagonist by the early traditionalist male writers.\" Christine N. Ohale, a professor at the department of English, Communications, Media Arts and Theater in Chicago State University, mentions that Nwapa's \"efforts to present brand-new, assertive and individualistic females have helped to salvage the lop-sided image that male writers have created\", which is mainly one of passiveness.\n\nParagraph 9: A griefer or bad-faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately and intentionally irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), by using aspects of the game in unintended ways in order to destroy something another player made or built, or stealing something, such as items or loot, when that is not the primary objective. A griefer derives pleasure primarily, or exclusively, from the act of annoying other users, and as such, is a particular nuisance in online gaming communities. If a bad-faith player is attempting to gain a strategic advantage, it could be considered cheating.\n\nParagraph 10: Vinay visits Gangtok, and meets another Amar associate, Neena. He promises to help her escape the gang in return for information. Neena, however, gets Vinay captured by luring him into the gang's safehouse. The gang's real leader is revealed to be Arjun, who is the jewel thief. No person named Amar ever existed; the identity was created to baffle the police and deflect any attention away from Arjun. Vishambhar Nath was part of this carefully planned scheme, too, while Shalini had assisted the gang to secure the release of her kidnapped brother, Shishu. When she approaches Arjun for Shishu's release, she gets locked up with him in the safehouse. Having discovered secret passages under the building, Shalini rescues Vinay and explains the situation to him. The three try to flee, but are recaptured. Vinay is administered electric shocks to wipe out his memory. The gang then make Vinay believe that 'jewel thief Amar' is his real identity. Their plan is to stage a fake heist of the Sikkimese crown jewels, and let 'Amar' take the blame. The police will be manipulated into shooting 'Amar' dead, forever lifting suspicion from the actual criminals. Since Shalini is a well-known dancer in the royal court, she is to facilitate the gang's entry disguised as a dance troupe. 'Amar' dies according to plan, and the gang celebrates. Vinay, however, had merely been acting; he had secretly warned the police about the gang's plan beforehand. Anjali, who has discovered her father's criminal involvement, has got in touch with the police too. The police surround the safehouse and Vinay corners Arjun, but he manages to escape. Vinay follows Arjun to his plane, but the latter threatens to shoot him. Anjali, though, has already removed the bullets in the gun, and the Commissioner appears to announce that the entire gang has been arrested, before January 26 as promised. Anjali takes Vinay to the cabin where Shalini is waiting for him with Shishu, as the plane gets airborne."}

April 9 started with several clusters of multi-cells, supercells, and bowing segments across much of the Deep South. Strong straight-line thunderstorm winds in Shreveport, Louisiana toppled a tree onto a mobile home around 6:30 p.m. (23:30 UTC), resulting in a fatality. Several large hail-producing supercells then formed and moved through areas from Oklahoma to North Texas before merging into a large squall line and surging southeastward into Arkansas and Louisiana, producing widespread wind damage. Meanwhile, several tornado-producing supercells formed ahead of the line. A weak EF0 tornado was recorded by several storm spotters near Pelahatchie, Mississippi, causing intermittent tree damage. Just after midnight on April 10, a large EF1 tornado ripped roofs off of sheds and carports and knocked down trees, including some that fell on homes, near Columbia, Mississippi. To the southwest, a low-end EF3 tornado tossed vehicles and damaged or destroyed several homes and mobile homes in the rural community of Waxia near Palmetto, Louisiana just after 2:00 a.m. CDT (07:00 UTC), resulting in one fatality and seven injuries. Later that morning, the squall line produced multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. A strong tornadic waterspout came onshore in Laguna Beach, Florida, causing severe EF2 damage to a business and damaging several homes. Another tornadic waterspout struck Gulf Lagoon Beach, located at the southeastern edge of the Panama City Beach city limits and caused EF0 damage to beach furniture. In Lynn Haven, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to an automotive business. That afternoon, isolated to widely scattered severe storms formed from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, producing sporadic wind and hail damage as well as isolated tornadoes into the overnight hours. An EF1 tornado also caused damage to businesses and a radio tower, and flipped a car near Seneca, South Carolina. A brief EF0 tornado damaged a few homes near Cutlerville, Michigan, and another EF0 tornado damaged a home near Reidville, South Carolina. Early on April 11, another EF1 tornado caused damage to homes and outbuildings near Belvoir, North Carolina. That afternoon, another squall line pushed southeastward down the entire Florida panhandle, producing mainly wind and hail damage, although a brief EF0 tornado that caused minor tree damage was confirmed near Eagle Lake. Another non-tornadic fatality occurred near Spring Hill when a person got out of their car after it was struck by a fallen tree and was electrocuted when they came in contact with downed power lines. Overall, the outbreak generated 20 tornadoes, resulting in one fatality. Two other non-tornadic deaths also occurred as a result of the severe weather. There was also at least $635 million in damage.\n\nParagraph 2: Msgr. Libert Boeynaems, SS.CC., Bishop of the Titular See of Zeugma and Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands, acquired the land on dry, rocky volcanic slope of Kaimuki for a church in 1901.  Meanwhile, the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts acquired a lot just west of the church lot and in 1909 had their convent and their school (Academy of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary) blessed.  By 1917, Kaimuki was developed and the convent chapel, dedicated under the title of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque was open to the public for Sunday worship.  A church was needed and the Vicar Apostolic instructed Father Athanasius Bous, SS.CC., to initiate work on building a new church for Kaimuki, securing the services of architect, R. A. Fishbourne.  A Romanesque cruciform structure was completed in 1929 and was solemnly dedicated on February 10, 1929, by Msgr. Stephen Peter Alencastre, SS.CC., Bishop of the Titular See of Arabissus and the (final) Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands.  The church was furnished with stained glass windows and two bells from Brussels.  Statues, altars, pulpit and vestments were donated by parishioners.  With the installation of a pipe organ, the church was complete.\n\nParagraph 3: The civil parish meets with Rothley to the south, and some houses are actually in Rothley parish near the southern A6 junction. To the west of the parish is a nature reserve. North of here, the Leicestershire Round passes east–west through the north of the village. The parish boundary meets Quorndon where it first meets the quarry near Buddon Wood. North of there, it crosses the former A6,  towards Quorn from the roundabout for the A6 roundabout. Close to the bypass, the River Soar becomes the parish boundary and south of the A6 northern junction it meets Sileby at the point where it crosses the A6 bypass.  south of there, the boundary leaves the river to the west, with the river becoming the Sileby-Rothley boundary.\n\nParagraph 4: One night, she overhears Ajay singing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, and sees his drawings of the kidnapper which imply that the kidnapper is still following him. One day at a carnival, she sees the kidnapper when meeting up with Raghu, but fails to follow him. She also loses Ajay but Raghu manages to find him. However, Ajay stabs the driver. When Raghu tells Ajay to drop his weapon, Ajay surprisingly listens to Raghu. When Rhythm sees a lot of insects, she passes out. Raghu brings her to her home because Gautham couldn't be reached. In the middle of the night, Ajay attempts to stab Rhythm's stomach but stops when she moves. Later the kidnapper breaks into Rhythm's house and communicates with Ajay via sign language. Rhythm tries to stop the kidnapper but he overpowers her and escapes. Doctor David suggests that Rhythm take Ajay to a speech therapist. On the way there though, Anjana's mom faints in the road so Gautham takes her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Rhythm's dog Cyrus finds human organs in a dumpster. Cyrus leads Rhythm to a house that belongs to David. Suspecting David, Rhythm finds a way to make him leave the house. She searches his house and finds a secret room where she finds Anjana. Cyrus helps Rhythm save Anjana and Ajay from David and gets David arrested. Anjana is reunited with her parents. However, Ajay is injured so Rhythm tells Gautham to take him to the hospital while she goes to the police station. When Rhythm questions David, it is revealed that he kills kids for their organs. David also reveals that if he had kidnapped Ajay, Ajay would have been dead. It is revealed that David wrote the Rest In Peace cards and sent the bouquet to divert the police from his crimes. David also says that the kidnapper is around Rhythm and that she has to look at things from a different point of view to figure out who the kidnapper is. She starts to suspect Raghu because Ajay listened to him. She attempts to call Gautham but he doesn't answer. She reaches the hospital where she sees that Gautham has been attacked. Gautham holds a glove and reveals that the kidnapper is female and says that she took Ajay. Rhythm runs through the clues in her head and figures out who the kidnapper is but she doesn't know why they kidnapped Ajay. She gets in the car and drives to a house. There is a blurred portrait of a woman. The kidnapper shows up and pulls off her mask revealing that she is Bhavana, Rhythm's childhood friend. Rhythm asks where Ajay is and Bhavana says that she'll tell Rhythm if she has a drink. Rhythm drinks the drink. Bhavana says that Rhythm will do anything for Ajay because Ajay is her world. But Bhavana says that when her world was shattered and she tried to fix it, she would see Rhythm in every shard. Bhavana's past is revealed through a brief flashback.\n\nParagraph 5: Similar to the atrium, the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the left ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. With respect to thermoregulation, the American flamingo has highly vascularized feet that use a countercurrent exchange system in their legs and feet. This method of thermoregulation keeps a constant gradient between the veins and arteries that are in close proximity in order to maintain heat within the core and minimize heat loss or gain in the extremities. Heat loss is minimized while wading in cold water, while heat gain is minimized in the hot temperatures during rest and flight.\n\nParagraph 6: \"[Seated opposite the patient] I placed his knees between mine, and began to pass my hands slowly over his face, at the distance of an inch, and carried them down to the pit of his stomach. This was continued for half an hour … [as there seemed to be no change] the passes were continued for a quarter of an hour longer — still no sensible effect. Being now tired (thermometer 85°), I gave it up in despair, and declared it to be a failure. While I rested myself, the man remained quiet, and made fewer grimaces, and when ordered to open his eyes, he said there was a smoke in the room. This roused my attention, and tempted me to persevere. I now breathed on his head, and carried my hands from the back of his head over his face and down to the Epigastrium, where I pressed them united. The first time this was done, he took his hands off his groins and pressed them both firmly down upon mine …. The same process was persevered in, and in about an hour he began to gape, said he must sleep, that his senses were gone; and his replies became incoherent. … All appearance of pain now disappeared; his hands were crossed on his breast, instead of being pressed on the groins, and his countenance showed the most perfect repose.\" -- (Esdaile, 1846, pp.43-44)\n\nParagraph 7: McLaren cars were specially designed race cars. The Can-Am cars were developments of the sports cars which were introduced in 1964 for the North American sports car races. The team works car for 1964 Was the M1. For 1965 the M1A prototype was the team car and bases for the Elva customer M1A cars. In lat 1965 the M1b(mk2) was the factory car in 1966 with Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon as drivers. In 1967, specifically for the Can-Am series, the McLaren team introduced a new model, the M6A. The McLaren M6A also introduced what was to become the trademark orange color for the team. The McLaren team was considered very \"multi national\" for the times and consisted of team owner and leader Bruce McLaren, fellow New Zealander Chris Amon and another \"kiwi\",  the 1967 Formula One world champion, Denny Hulme, team manager Teddy Mayer, mechanics Tyler Alexander, Gary Knutson, Lee Muir, George Bolthoff, Frank Zimmerman, Tom Anderson, Alan Anderson, David Dunlap, Leo Beattie, Donny Ray Everett, and Haig Alltounian (all from the US), Don Beresford, Alec Greaves, Vince Higgins, and Roger Bailey (UK), Tony Attard (Australia), Cary Taylor, Jimmy Stone, Chris Charles, Colin Beanland, Alan McCall and Alistair Caldwell (NZ). The M6 series were a full aluminum monocoque design with no uncommon features but, for the times, there was an uncommon attention to detail in preparation by the team members. The M6 series of cars were powered by Chevy \"mouse-motor\" small-block V8s built by Al Bartz Engines in Van Nuys, California. They were models of reliability. This was followed in 1968 by the M8A, a new design based around the Chevy big-block V8 \"rat motor\" as a stressed member of the chassis. McLaren went \"in house\" with their engine shop in 1969. The M8B, M8C, M8D and M20C were developments of that aluminum monocoque chassis.\n\nParagraph 8: On the start of the monsoon, the project gets suspended and the daily wage workers are left without jobs. Naik and Palegar declare that they will take care of everyone without a job by taking them to the city and keeping them in their homes. They convince the project owner and a reluctant Purushottham to make the people go with them to the city. Naik takes the entire group to his house while Palegar takes Belli to his house. Naik's family refuses to acknowledge him and the people while he innocently makes them settle in his house. His father, brother and sister in law walk out of the house in a huff but his mother takes his side and appreciates his choice of a fiancé in Parvathi. Meanwhile, Palegar's father has been made the chairman of a disabled institution. He ironically refuses to accept his son marrying a blind girl and throws both of them out. Naik tries to convince Dalavayee to take Roopli back but Dalavayee's marriage has been fixed to a rich man's daughter who has promised him an imported car as a gift. However, the plight of Roopli and the people he stayed with makes him change his mind and he decides to convince his parents. Naik takes Palegar and Belli and returns to his house to find that all his guests have been thrown out by his family with a warning that the police will be called in case they try to reenter the house. Naik storms in and fights with his father, brother and sister in law while his mother remains a mute spectator. Dalavayee tries to reason with his parents about accepting Roopli as his wife but his parents, disappointed that they will not be getting the assured gifts from his arranged marriage disinherit him and throw him out at gunpoint. Roopli tries to make him leave her and go back to his parents but he rushes back in and shoots them with the same gun. He then tells Roopli to enjoy the few moments they have together before he gets arrested. At Naik's house, his family makes it clear that they want nothing to do with him or his group with the exception of his mother who declares that she is proud of him for his ideals, but goes back inside eventually. The police are called and in the melee that follows, Palegar goes after a running Belli to fall under a speeding truck. He dies after voicing his last wish to have his eyes donated to Belli and requesting Naik to make her see the good that the world has to offer. Naik, who is visibly crushed, cradles the head of his dead friend and questions aloud as to why is god being so cruel with them to which a disembodied voice replies that God is not cruel. It is the society instead, who is cruel, having made divisions based on caste, status, language and other differences. The movie ends with the voice saying that these forces in the society have made people forget about the true purpose of life, happiness.\n\nParagraph 9: On 18 November 2017, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the Sanctuary for Independent Media said, \"For the past decade he has made fearless, multiple award winning films about faith, identity, religious extremism and social justice. The Washington Post said about the second film, \"In the film, Sharma condemns the Saudi government's strict interpretation of Islam, which he says promotes the dangerous ideology that produces groups such as the militant Islamic State.\" Reviewing A Jihad for Love the newspaper had said, \"Sharma is right to keep his focus tight. He is interested in the faithful and their conflicts, not the broader cultural issues surrounding sex and Islamic society.\" The Los Angeles Times said Sharma \"crossed several dangerous lines in his work and the government in Singapore banned A Jihad for Love and that the Muslim Judicial Council in South Africa has declared him an apostate.\" Fridae Asia reported, \"A Jihad for Love - which Singapore censors say is too controversial to be shown at the country's international film festival last year - was broadcast to potentially more than a billion in India and other countries by India's NDTV.\" A Jihad for Love was banned from the Singapore International Film Festival in 2008 by the Media Development Authority, which oversees the censorship board, \"in view of the sensitive nature of the subject that features Muslim homosexuals in various countries and their struggle to reconcile religion and their lifestyle.\" About 14 percent of Singapore's 4.4 million population is Muslim. Singapore banned A Sinner in Mecca, as did Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Yet semi-open screenings were held in Cairo, Kuala Lumpur and Karachi. In just its opening week during a limited release of 33 cities, A Jihad for Love, for example, ran for four weeks at New York's IFC theaters. The film grossed $22,287, out of which, $10,519 was just in New York. The Domestic Total Gross for the film is $105,659. A Jihad for Love was theatrically released in 33 cities, while A Sinner in Mecca was only released in four cities, for a week each. Its box office numbers were low, except in New York where it had a higher box office return of $11,220.\n\nParagraph 10: Don Francisco was married to Donna Paula Diez, believed to be the sister of Don Antonio Filareto Diez e Palermo, a Sicilian Nobleman and Senator of Palermo in 1745 and 1764.

Another meaning is that the document is under no circumstances to be copied or photographed, \"eyes only\" meaning that it is to be physically read by cleared personnel and nothing more, to ensure that no unauthorized copies of the text are made which might be unaccounted for.\n\nParagraph 2: The Cairo Fire resulted in the dismissal of Nahhas Pasha and the formation of a new short-lived government headed by Ali Maher Pasha. The new government decided to send an official Egyptian delegation to the funeral of King George VI as a reconciliatory measure towards the United Kingdom. Amr Pasha was dispatched to London in his capacity as ambassador, along with Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim, in order to attend the funeral, which was held on 15 February 1952. Nevertheless, Amr did not present new letters of credence to the new British sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II. The Maher government had to address two major national issues: the departure () of British military forces from the Suez Canal zone, and the unification () of Egypt and Sudan, which had hitherto been jointly administered by Egypt and the United Kingdom as a condominium. As a result, Anglo-Egyptian talks about negotiations were conducted, in which Amr Pasha played a major role. As Egypt's ambassador to the United Kingdom, he shuttled between London and Cairo trying to convey the Egyptian position to British politicians, notably Foreign Minister Anthony Eden, and then advise Egyptian leaders on the response. After the fall of the Maher government and its replacement by that of El-Hilali Pasha, the first official negotiating meeting took place on 22 March 1952. Amr was part of the Egyptian negotiating team, which also included El-Hilali Pasha himself as well as Foreign Minister Abdel-Khaleq Hassouna Pasha. The British side refused to commit itself publicly to \"the principle of evacuation\" before the start of the negotiations. The day after the official start of the negotiations, the Egyptian Parliament was dismissed. New elections were scheduled for 18 May, and martial law was extended indefinitely. The extreme political instability Egypt was witnessing at the time resulted in a military coup on 23 July 1952. After King Farouk's abdication in favor of his infant son Fuad II, the new Regency Council forced Amr into retirement at the end of August of the same year, replacing him as ambassador in London by Mahmoud Fawzi.\n\nParagraph 3: The townland formed part of the ballybethagh of Calvagh in medieval times. As it was a border townland the ownership was contested between the McGovern and Maguire clans. At the time of the 1609 Ulster Plantation the townland was overlooked and does not appear on the Plantation Baronial maps. The map for Knockninny barony stops on the east bank of the stream entering the Woodford river between the townlands of Derryhooly and Corry townlands, while the Tullyhaw barony map stops where the Irish border is now, thus omitting that part of Tomregan parish which lies in County Fermanagh. The mapping of Fermanagh and Cavan only took about 10 days each, which was insufficient time to make a proper survey. A different surveyor was sent into each barony to draw up his own map so the error probably arose because the surveyor who drew the Knockninny map assumed the omitted townlands were in County Cavan and the Tullyhaw surveyor who was probably a different man then assumed the lands were in County Fermanagh. The confusion continued for a few years. Firstly a grant was made to Thomas Monepeny on 15 October 1610 of the Manor of Aghalane, which included one tate of Corgelouse. Taking advantage of this, Lady Margaret O’Neill, the widow of Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh) claimed the land. An order of the Lord Deputy dated 14 October 1612 states- Wheras The Lady Margrett ny Neale, wyddowe, late wyfe to Sir Hugh Maguyre knight deceased, hath discovered the parcells of land beinge eight tates, and doe lye betweene Knockneny in the County of Fermanagh and Tollagh in the County of Cavan and not within anie Undertakers portion who have since enjoyed the same as it hath been certified by the Surveyors ... we enact  that the said Lady Margrett shall receive the next Hallowtyde rent due out of the said eight tates and thence forth until his Majesty decides otherwise. The eight tates included one tate of Cerglles Natowicke and Portnicke. Lady Margaret then seems to have left the scene because, on 31 July 1613, Thomas Monepeny sold the Manor of Aghalane to Thomas Creighton. Thomas Creighton then died in 1618, and his widow Katherine married George Adwick. The estate descended to Thomas Creighton's son, David Creighton. He was a minor at his father's death so his mother and George Adwick administered the estate on his behalf. An Inquisition held at Castlecoote on 5 November 1629 stated that David Creighton owned, inter alia, the lands of Corgelouse. However there seems to have been some dispute with Sir Stephen Butler, who owned the adjoining manor, as an Inquisition held at Netownbutler on 20 January 1630 stated that Sir Stephen Butler owned, inter alia, the lands of Corgetesse alias Corgeluse. Pender's Census of 1659 spells the name as Corrogabees and states there were 5 people over the age of 15 living in the townland, all Irish, (In general the percentage of the Irish population aged under 15 runs at about 20% so the total population of the townland in 1659 would have been roughly about 6). A grant dated 8 December 1675 to Charles Balfour of Castle Balfour, included, inter alia, the lands of Garteegeeleese. A lease dated 28 July 1721 from William Balfour to Hugh Henry includes, inter alia, the lands of Carrigg alias Carglouse.\n\nParagraph 4: On the following night, the June 25 episode of Raw Is War, Shane declared his intention to invade the WWF, and the Invasion storyline started with Booker T performing a scissors kick to Vince. On the June 28 episode of SmackDown!, it was decided that Fully Loaded was to be changed to Invasion, and would feature matches between WWF and WCW. The ultimate goal, reportedly, was for WCW to \"take over\" one of the WWF's two primary programs, either Raw Is War or SmackDown!, and rebrand it as its own separate entity.  To test the waters for this, the final twenty minutes of the July 2 Raw Is War telecast was given over to WCW, which brought in its own commentators (Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson), ring announcer (Stacy Keibler), referee (Nick Patrick), ring apron, and Chyron graphics, to present a match between Booker T and Buff Bagwell for Booker's WCW Championship (which he had won on the final episode of Nitro). This continued on SmackDown!, where Gregory Helms lost the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Billy Kidman and Booker defended the WCW Championship against Diamond Dallas Page. The Booker/Bagwell title match, however, was very poorly received both by television viewers and the live crowd in the arena; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called the bout \"the worst match ever\". The two other WCW matches also received a negative fan reaction. The decision was thus made to make WCW a heel group who was out to destroy the WWF. On the July 9 on Raw Is War, when then-face WCW owner Shane was scheduled to face Page in a street fight, the two instead attacked The Undertaker, turning Shane heel (Page had already debuted in WWF as a heel, as part of a stalker angle with Undertaker and his wife). Later that night, Chris Jericho and Kane (from the WWF) fought Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (from WCW) in a tag team match. It ended in a no contest when the ECW Alumni from both the WWF and WCW along with the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer made their way to the ring. As it looked as though they were going after Storm and Awesome, they instead attacked Jericho and Kane. This led to the Raw color-commentator Paul Heyman leaving the announcer's booth and declared that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) has joined the invasion and stated that the invasion has been taken to the extreme, leading to some WWF and WCW wrestlers (including Raven, Lance Storm, Rhyno, The Dudley Boyz, and Tazz) defecting to ECW. Shane appeared to co-operate with Vince against ECW, but later that night, it was revealed that WCW and ECW had merged, and that Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley (who was last seen on the May 21 episode of Raw Is War) now owned ECW.\n\nParagraph 5: In the 19th century Allington comprised two parishes, East and West, but centred on one village as a township which looked after the poor of both parishes. In 1872 White's Directory reported that East Allington had a population of 267, and West Allington 141. The combined area of both parishes was , two-thirds of which was owned by the lord of the manor, John Earle Welby of Allington Hall. Noted was the \"farm house... in Elizabethan style\" [on Bottesford Road] \"said to be the ancient manor house\". The village cross is mentioned, as is a \"copious\" chalybeate spring called 'Saltwell' at the south. The ecclesiastical parish of Holy Trinity Church in West Allington was a rectory in the gift of the Lord Chancellor; the incumbent, in lieu of tithes, received  of glebe – an area of land used to support a parish priest – and a rectory house built in 1870 for £1,250. The parish of East Allington, under St James Church (restored in 1855), received a benefice which was combined with that of Sedgebrook, and included  of glebe. The feast day for both Allington parishes was on Old Michaelmas Day. A National School had been built in 1848 by the lord of the manor, and in 1858 a Primitive Methodist chapel was built for £250. Professions and trades listed in 1872 for West Allingon were the parish rector, a tailor, two joiners & undertakers, and four farmers, two of whom were also graziers. Listed for East Allington were a schoolmistress, a shopkeeper, a mason who was also a bricklayer and contractor, a brewer, the licensed victualler of the Welby Arms who was also a farmer and grazier, and five further farmers, one of whom was also a coal & lime merchant, two a grazier, and another a grazier and butcher.\n\nParagraph 6: The first grouping initially known as \"The Johnson Boys\", formed in 1975 as a duo featuring Dudley Connell on banjo and Ron Welch on guitar.  Eddie D'Zmura, a high school friend of Dudley Connell's, joined soon thereafter on mandolin. The band was renamed, \"The Johnson Mountain Boys\" after learning of another folk band already using the \"Johnson Boys\" name. The name The Johnson Mountain Boys was suggested by George Connell, Dudley's father. The \"Johnson Mountain\" referred to in the name of the band is a fictitious name (i.e. there is no Johnson Mountain in any of the areas from which any of the band members came).  The group became a full five-piece band in January 1978 featuring Connell on guitar, Franny Davidson on banjo—replaced by Richard Underwood after the band's first recording session—Eddie D'Zmura on mandolin, David McLaughlin on fiddle, and Gary Reid on bass.  Gary Reid left the group in late 1978 and started the Copper Creek record company.  He was replaced by Mark Prindle on the bass.  The Johnson Mountain Boys first commercial record release was Copper Creek Records number 0001 featuring original instrumental composition \"Johnson Mountain Hoedown\" written by Dudley Connell and Ed D'Zmura. The B side was \"When I Can Forget\" a song written by Dudley Connell.  The personnel on the record was Dudley Connell on guitar and vocals, David McLaughlin on fiddle and vocals, Ed D'Zmura on mandolin, Franny Davidson on banjo, and Mark Prindle on bass.  After the release of the first Copper Creek single, David McLaughlin went off to college and continued to play fiddle part-time with the band.  After David McLaughlin left for college, Eddie Stubbs performed his first show on fiddle with the Johnson Mountain Boys in November 1978 when he was just 16 years old, just a week before his 17th birthday.  From that point, he was considered the main fiddle player for the group, but played only once per week with the group since he was still in high school (senior year).  Since Eddie was not able to perform every show because of school, the fiddle duties were covered by David McLaughlin, Bill Belford, and Carl Nelson when Eddie was not able to appear.  In May 1979, Eddie became the full-time fiddle player for the group at age 17.  He graduated from Gaithersburg High School that June.  In 1979, before the recording of their second Copper Creek record, Mark Prindle was replaced by Larry Robbins on bass.  The group's second record was Copper Creek Records number 0101, an EP featuring \"Sitting Alone in the Moonlight,\" \"Eddie's Hoedown,\" \"Where We'll Never Die,\" and \"No Depression in Heaven.\"  In 1980, the band was picked up by Rounder Records.  The group's self-titled first album won considerable acclaim.  After the release of their first Rounder album, David McLaughlin left college in early 1981 to rejoin the group full-time, replacing Ed D'Zmura on mandolin.  Subsequent albums made the group young standard bearers of traditional bluegrass in the 1980s. In 1986, there were two personnel changes. Marshall Wilborn replaced Larry Robbins on bass in June and Tom Adams replaced Richard Underwood on banjo in September.\n\nParagraph 7: Behavioral therapy is beneficial when simpler measures are not effective. Habit Reversal Training (HRT), which seeks to unlearn the habit of nail biting and possibly replace it with a more constructive habit, has shown its effectiveness versus placebo in children and adults. A study in children showed that results with HRT were superior to either no treatment at all or the manipulation of objects as an alternative behavior, which is another possible approach to treatment. In addition to HRT, stimulus control therapy is used to both identify and then eliminate the stimulus that frequently triggers biting urges. Other behavioral techniques that have been investigated with preliminary positive results are self-help techniques, such as decoupling and the use of wristbands as non-removable reminders. More recently, technology companies have begun producing wearable devices and smart watch applications that track the position of users' hands but no research has been published so far.\n\nParagraph 8: The 1778 Il Paese de' Selvaggi Outauacesi, e Kilistinesi Intorno al Lago Superiore map by John Mitchell identifies the lake as Lago Nepigon and its outlet as F. Nempissaki. In the 1807 map A New Map of Upper & Lower Canada by John Cary, the lake was called Lake St Ann or Winnimpig, while the outflowing river as Red Stone R.  Today, the Red Rock First Nation located along the Nipigon River still bears the \"Red Stone\" name. In the 1827 map Partie de la Nouvelle Bretagne. by Philippe Vandermaelen, the lake was called L. Ste Anne, while the outflowing river as R. Nipigeon.  In the 1832 map North America sheet IV. Lake Superior. by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, the lake was called St Ann or Red L., while the outflowing river as Neepigeon and the heights near the outlet of the Gull River as Neepigon Ho. By 1883, maps such as Statistical & General Map of Canada by Letts, Son & Co., consistently began identify the lake as Lake Nipigon.\n\nParagraph 9: Homer and Bart say the car was stolen in the church parking lot. The next morning they are surprised however to learn that Groundskeeper Willie was arrested for stealing the car, as he matched the description they gave of the carjacker as a \"foreign loner with wild, bushy hair\". Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer to say that it was Willie who stole the car. After Willie is proven guilty, he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point, Homer finally confesses that he got conned, but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack and the gun was loaded with blanks), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. (Willie, however, was not privy to this scheme, as he angrily states.) As Lisa is ready to explain why the town, media and police officials had \"nothing better to do\" than show them the consequences of their actions, Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'. The scene then cuts to Springfield at the beach, with characters from the episode surfing, including the waiter from the restaurant, the two astronauts from the Mir space station and the sturgeon swimming in the sea.\n\nParagraph 10: When the Federal (Union) troops reached the vicinity of Chester Station they were divided into two wings. The left wing, commanded by Maj. O. S. Sanford of the 7th Connecticut Infantry, moved up the railroad toward Chester Station, where the 6th Connecticut Infantry was engaged in tearing up the track, and remained there for about an hour, when orders came to join the other column on the turnpike below. Here the right wing, commanded by Col. C. J. Dobbs of the 13th Indiana Infantry, had encountered a force of Confederates too large to overcome, and Dobbs sent back for reinforcements. In the meantime he formed line of battle with his own regiment on the left, the 169th New York Infantry on the right, one section of the 1st Connecticut battery in front, supported by a detachment of the 67th Ohio Infantry, and awaited the onset. The Confederates, with infantry, cavalry and artillery, advanced, and when they were within easy range Dobbs gave the command to fire. A tremendous volley from his entire line checked the Confederate advance, and a second threw them into confusion, compelling them to retire for the purpose of reforming their lines. At this juncture Sanford arrived with the left wing and went into position with the 6th Connecticut Infantry on the right of the road and the 7th on the left as supports to the advanced lines. Two companies of the 7th Connecticut Infantry were sent forward to support a battery, and the remainder of the regiment moved up to the top of the hill and opened fire on the Confederate's left, driving them back to the woods. One of the guns of the 4th New Jersey battery was abandoned by the men, and an effort to capture this piece was thwarted by this regiment, Sanford sending Lieut. Barker with Co. K to bring in the gun, which he did in the face of a galling fire. The 7th New Hampshire Infantry came up and went into position just as the Confederates advanced again, having been reinforced, and again they were allowed to come within easy range, when they were greeted with a murderous fire from both artillery and infantry. This settled the contest. After a vain endeavor to rally the shattered ranks the Confederate officers gave up the attempt and sought the cover of the woods. Gen. A. H. Terry, commanding the 1st division, 10th corps, arrived on the field after the action had begun, and during the latter part of the engagement directed the movements of the Union troops."}

CAFOs release several types of gas emissions—ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and particulate matter—all of which bear varying human health risks. The amount of gas emissions depends largely on the size of the CAFO. The primary cause of gas emissions from CAFOs is the decomposition of animal manure being stored in large quantities. Additionally, CAFOs emit strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria into the surrounding air, particularly downwind from the facility. Levels of antibiotics measured downwind from swine CAFOs were three times higher than those measured upwind. While it is not widely known what is the source of these emissions, the animal feed is suspected.Globally, ruminant livestock are responsible for about 115 Tg/a of the 330 Tg/a (35%) of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions released per year. Livestock operations are responsible for about 18% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and over 7% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Methane is the second most concentrated greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change, with livestock contributing nearly 30% of anthropogenic methane emissions. Only 17% of these livestock emissions are due to manure management, with the majority resulting from enteric fermentation, or gases produced during digestion. With regards to antibiotic resistant bacteria, Staphylococcus Aureus accounts for 76% of bacteria grown within a swine CAFO. Group A Streptococci, and Fecal Coliforms were the two next most prevalent bacteria grown within the ambient air inside of swine CAFO.\n\nParagraph 2: At that point, Flight 610 was scheduled to make a right turn to intercept the 168° course line of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, its next clearance limit. To intercept that course line, the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210°, which was a proper intercept angle of almost 45°. If the pilot had configured his audio selector switches properly, he would have been able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of \"A\", for the north side of that low frequency range. As he neared the course line itself, he would then have begun to hear the \"N\" identifier, the signal to turn left again, and could track the 168° course line to the WONT intersection.\n\nParagraph 3: The Ur-Quan are a fictional race of predatory alien caterpillars in the Star Control series of video games, created by Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford. Introduced in 1990, the Ur-Quan are the primary antagonist of the first game, leading a galactic empire that seeks to enslave Earth. They reprise their role in Star Control II, which expands on their history as former slaves who since vowed to fiercely defend themselves. During the game, the Ur-Quan enter into a civil war over their ideology, giving Earth an opportunity to defeat them. In Star Control 3, which was developed by a different team, the Ur-Quan ally with Earth against a different antagonist and their role is scaled back. They appear once again in The Ur-Quan Masters, the 2002 open source remake of Star Control II.Reiche and Ford developed the Ur-Quan based on the concepts for unique spaceships in Star Control; their insectoid appearance was inspired by a National Geographic photo of a caterpillar. Their role in Star Control II has earned acclaim among the best game villains in history, praised for their menacing persona, as well as their surprising depth and humanity. The Ur-Quan have also influenced other game studios, inspiring concepts in games such as Mass Effect and Stellaris.\n\nParagraph 4: A lap of 123.600 mph on lap 3 by Steve Plater riding a 600cc Yamaha, passed Ian Lougher and Conor Cummins to claim 5th place. The fast race pace was continued by Bruce Anstey, completing lap 2 in 18 minutes and 3.40 seconds an average speed of 125.372 and breaking the lap record previously held by Guy Martin for the Junior TT by 1.63 seconds. At the pit-stop at the end of lap 2, Bruce Anstey led by 24.82 seconds from McGuinness who had regained 2nd place with a slender lead of 0.08 second of Keith Amor. A much faster pit-stop by McGuinness reduced the lead of Bruce Anstey by 5 seconds, although this advantage was reduced by Ballaugh Bridge on lap 3 and Anstey's lead was now back to 21 seconds. Another lap of 119.040 mph on lap 3 by Steve Plater elevated him to 4th place, passing the Kawasaki of Ryan Farquhar. This was followed by another lap of 124.363 mph by Steve Plater on lap 4, passing Keith Amor at Glen Helen on corrected time for 3rd place and only 9 seconds behind McGuinness in 2nd place reducing the gap between Plater and McGuinness to 5 seconds at Ramsey Hairpin on the last lap.

A post-race technical inspection of the 600cc Suzuki of Bruce Anstey discovered an oversized exhaust-cam lifter at 8.75 mm as the Supersport regulations define a maximum limit of 8.00 mm. The TT race organiser accepted that a mistake by the race engine builder caused by a mis-labelled exhaust cam part resulted in the breach of the race homologation rules and the subsequent disqualification of the 600cc Suzuki of Bruce Anstey from first place.

Sun Valley becomes \"Stone Valley\" and is run by \"Conrad Hailstone\" (Conrad Hilton). The last names \"Flintstone\" and \"Rubble\", as well as other common Bedrock surnames such as \"Shale\" and \"Quartz\", are in line with these puns, as are the names of Bedrock's celebrities: \"Cary Granite\" (Cary Grant), \"Stony Curtis\" (Tony Curtis), \"Ed Sulleyrock/Sulleystone\" (Ed Sullivan), \"Rock Pile/Quarry/Hudstone\" (Rock Hudson), \"Ann-Margrock\" (Ann-Margret), \"Jimmy Darrock\" (James Darren), \"Alvin Brickrock\" (Alfred Hitchcock), \"Perry Masonary/Masonite\" (Perry Mason as played by Raymond Burr), \"Mick Jadestone and The Rolling Boulders\" (Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones, called \"Mick Jagged and the Stones\" in the live-action film The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''), \"Eppy Brianstone\" (Brian Epstein) and \"The Beau Brummelstones\" (The Beau Brummels). Once, while visiting one of Bedrock's houses of \"Haute Couture\" with Wilma, Betty even commented on the new \"Jackie Kennerock (Jackie Kennedy) look\". In some cases, the celebrity featured also provided the voice: \"Samantha\" and \"Darrin\" from Bewitched were voiced by Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York. Examples from the above list include Ann-Margret, Curtis, Darren, and the Beau Brummels. Other celebrities, such as \"Ed Sulleystone\" and \"Alvin Brickrock\", were rendered by impersonators.

At the engagement party Simi dances with Vicky and Rohan dances with Preeti. After the engagement party Vicky flies out on a business trip, whilst Rohan, Simi and Preeti attend a party. At the party, whilst Rohan and Preeti are dancing, Ranjit visits Simi, he says he was on the way to the airport but wanted to give Simi a gift before he left, as her family looked after him very well during his trip in India. Ranjit says he left the gift in the cab and persuades Simi to follow him to the cab to get the gift. However, before they could reach the cab, Ranjit pushes Simi into a spare room and brutally rapes her. Simi calls out Rohan's name but by the time Rohan comes, it's too late. Rohan chases the cab that Ranjit is in, but Ranjit's cab meets with an accident and Ranjit dies. Simi doesn't tell Vicky and wants to wait to tell him in person. Whilst on the way to pick Vicky from the airport, Simi is on the phone with Rohan, when she has an accident. At the hospital, the Doctor tells Rohan that Simi is pregnant and abortion shouldn't be considered as it is very risky, which Vicky overhears. No one believes, Simi when she tells them that Ranjit raped her, Simi's parents and Vicky blame Rohan and Vicky calls off the engagement and leaves. Rohan decides to accept Simi and the baby and proposes to her to save her from humiliation; they get engaged. Just as the wedding is approaching, and Simi is heavily pregnant, Vicky returns. He realized he was wrong and asks for a second chance, Simi agrees. Rohan pretends to be happy for Simi, but he's really heartbroken, as he truly loves Simi. At Rohan's football match, Simi explains to Vicky that they're only pretending to be a couple, so that Rohan and Preeti can get back together. Preeti enters and tells Simi that Rohan loves Simi and only Simi. At this point, Simi gets labour pains and everyone rushes her to the hospital. Simi gives birth to a baby girl and when the nurse asks who the father is she says Rohan's name. After this, both Simi and Rohan are together.\n\nParagraph 7: Illinois 8 largely parallels Interstate 74 from Maquon to Washington.  After entering Peoria from the west, it crosses the Illinois River with Illinois Route 116 on the Cedar Street Bridge between Peoria and East Peoria. Illinois 8/116 stays joined until Camp Street, where U.S. Route 24 and Illinois Route 29/116 continue geographically northeast, and are signed east and north, respectively, with U.S. Route 150 westbound, forming a wrong-way concurrency. Illinois 8 turns east onto Camp Street with U.S. 150 eastbound. In spite of this concurrency, up until 2005 the eastbound I-74 exit to Camp Street was only marked for U.S. 150, while the next eastbound exit to Washington Street was marked as \"To Illinois 8\" even though Washington Street is unnumbered in East Peoria. At the Washington Street intersection, U.S. 150 leaves Illinois 8 and runs east-southeast towards Morton, while Illinois 8 runs east-northeast through unincorporated Sunnyland.\n\nParagraph 8: Although the Voree area was inhabited by Native Americans prior to the arrival of the first Europeans, the most notable part of its  history begins in 1844, after the death of Joseph Smith Jr., founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. James J. Strang, who had declared himself Smith's successor, established Voree, then within the Wisconsin Territory as a \"gathering place\" for those Latter Day Saints who chose to follow his leadership rather than that of Brigham Young or other claimants. Strang's followers moved from Nauvoo, Illinois and other places to Voree. Young's followers relocated to the Salt Lake Valley in what would ultimately become the Utah Territory, where they established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is now the largest \"Mormon\" denomination. The Strang, Young, and several other church organizations claimed to be the sole legal continuance and succession leader of Joseph Smith's church, each rejecting all claims to legitimacy by the others.\n\nParagraph 9: In audio engineering, electronics, physics, and many other fields, the color of noise or noise spectrum refers to the power spectrum of a noise signal (a signal produced by a stochastic process). Different colors of noise have significantly different properties. For example, as audio signals they will sound differently to human ears, and as images they will have a visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific color. This sense of 'color' for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called \"tone color\"; however, the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum).\n\nParagraph 10: A digital ion trap (DIT) is an ion trap having a trapping waveform generated by the rapid switching between discrete high-voltage levels. The timing of the high voltage switch is controlled precisely with digital electronic circuitry. Ion motion in a quadrupole ion trap driven by a rectangular wave signal was theoretically studied in 1970s by Sheretov, E.P. and Richards, J.A. Sheretov also implemented the pulsed waveform drive for the quadrupole ion trap working in mass-selective instability mode, although no resonance excitation/ejection was used. The idea was substantially revisited by Ding L. and Kumashiro S. in 1999, where the ion stability in the rectangular wave quadrupole field was mapped in the Mathieu space a-q coordinate system, with the parameters a and q having the same definition as the Mathieu parameters normally used in dealing with sinusoidal RF driven quadrupole field. The secular frequency dependence on the a, q parameters was also derived thus the foundation was laid for many modern ion trap operation modes based on the resonance excitation. Also, in 1999, Peter T.A. Reilly began trapping and subsequently ablating and mass analyzing the product ions from nanoparticles obtained from car exhaust with a primitive hybrid square wave/sine wave driven 3D ion trap. In 2001 Reilly attended the 49th American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Applied Topics where he presented his nanoparticle mass analysis work and met Li Ding for the first time. Reilly suggested to Ding at that time that they should focus the DIT for analysis in the high mass range where other instruments could not compete. However, work published by Ding and Shimadzu over the years following the 2001 meeting were focused on development of square wave driven DIT's in the conventional mass range of commercial instrumentation. During this time Reilly began developing digital waveforms to increase the mass range of quadrupole-based mass spectrometers and ion traps that operate with rectangular waveforms. Over the course of eighteen years, the Reilly group contributed substantially to the development of modern digital waveform technology (DWT), its implementation and characterization, methods of waveform generation, and general theory which includes but is not limited to stability diagrams, the pseudopotential model, and more recently digital quadrupole acceptance. In parallel to Reilly's achievements but also working separately, the Ding group at the Shimadzu Research Lab continued to implement their digital drive technology for a 3D ion trap. Finally, after 18 years Shimadzu unveiled a bench top MALDI square wave driven 3D ion trap mass spectrometer that was designed to work in the higher mass range at the 2019 ASMS conference. The DIT technology has also been developed and implemented in the linear and 3D quadrupole ion traps by many other groups around the world."}

According to the Kiowa story, their shaman had prophesied that a larger party with more plunder would follow. Later, the warriors attacked a convoy of mule-drawn wagons and killed seven muleskinners, torturing one to death. They managed to escape with supplies and brought the story to Fort Richardson.

The team was also ranked 23rd in the Lindy’s Preseason Top 25 poll and 24th in the Sporting News Preseason Top 25 poll. The UWA football team recorded its highest pre-season ranking since 1976 as the Tigers were selected second by the head coaches of the 2010 Gulf South Conference in the GSC Pre-Season Poll. West Alabama opened the season on August 28 against NAIA member Shorter in nearby Demopolis, Alabama. Tiger Stadium was renovated, and a synthetic surface was recently installed. The Tigers played their first contest on the new surface on September 18 against Lambuth but were narrowly defeated. UWA opened Gulf South Conference play with a home win over West Georgia but lost to Delta State on the road. After a 3-2 start, the Tigers reeled off three consecutive wins, including a last-second homecoming victory over Henderson State. It appeared the game had ended, but officials put a second back on the clock. Quarterback Deon Williams connected to wide receiver Gerald Worsham in the back of the endzone for the game-winner. The team lost back to back in the following two weeks before returning home to face Valdosta State in the season finale. The day before the contest, Bobby Wallace announced to his players that he would be stepping down as head coach upon the end of the season. After falling behind and trailing at the half, the Tigers upset the number 7-ranked Blazers to give Wallace a victory in his final game. The team notched its second win against Valdosta State and picked up their first win in the series since 1985. UWA finished the season 7-4 to earn consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. Deon Williams was recognized as one of 24 candidates for the Harlon Hill Trophy, the Division II equivalent to Division I's Heisman Trophy. Offensive coordinator Will Hall was named Bobby Wallace's successor a week after the season concluded. Bobby Wallace was inducted into the Division II Hall of Fame in December. The 2011 team went 8-4, beat DI foe Georgia State, and qualified for the NCAA DII tournament. The 2012 team went undefeated in Gulf South play (5-0) to claim the conference title. UWA defeated Miles College 41-7 in round one of the playoffs. The team lost at eventual national champion Valdosta State 49-21 in the second round. UWA finished 9-4.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1819 the Metropolita of Ioannina Gabriel visited the communities which suffered from the disease, and in the town he met 160 inhabitants. In a letter of Ath. Psalidis dated 12-2-1823, sent to Movrokordatos, he described the situation of the Epirus and Tessally, under the Turkish occupation, showing an armed struggle for liberation. It reports that in the town of Dobrinovo where people live, they were able to carry weapons. The town of Dobrinovo in that period used the school separated for the boys and the girls and was constructed using the aqueduct that brought water to the town and bridges that opened new roads. The inhabitants of Dobrinovo travelled a lot and became traders, but they did not forget their town and they contributed for its development. The Greek newspaper published in Constantinopolis, speaks about 1200 inhabitants in the town of Dobrinovo. Unfortunately for the town, there followed a period of economic decadence. The Balkan wars in 1912, then the First World War, blocked the trade activities that the Iliochorites had created with the countries like Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, until Russia. Later with the arrival of the Spanish flu pulled down on all the towns including Dobrinovo (Iliochori) with numerous victims.\n\nParagraph 4: —Ibid., p. 146The detective displays similar manners whilst intimidating villains who pop up as witnesses in his investigation:'Oh, sorry. Yes, that one. Yes, I get you now.''Do you?' I said. 'Lucky for you. Because you could find yourself in a bit of bother if you didn’t look out. I might decide I wanted to wind you right up tight if you misled me, just to see what would happen. And do you know what would happen, fatty? You’d go off pop! Like that.''Okay, okay,' he said. —Ibid., p. 33Such social shortcomings find their counterpart in a nearly psychotic identification with the mutilated bodies of murder victims whom the hero relentlessly avenges. The detective finds Staniland's recorded journals. He listens to the voice of the murder victim ruminate on his sense of being trapped in his body and the possibility of release through death. The tapes convey a poetic diction infected with haunted sensibilities:The next tape of Staniland’s I played started:I dreamed I was walking through the door of a cathedral. Someone I couldn’t distinguish warned me: 'Don’t go in there, it’s haunted.' However, I went straight in and glided up the nave to the altar. The roof of the building was too high to see; the quoins were lost in a dark fog through which the votive lamps glowed orange. The only light came through the diamond-shaped clear panes in the windows; it was faint and cold. This neglected mass was attached to a sprawl of vaulted ruins; I had been in them all night; I had wandered through them for centuries. They had once been my home; burned-out rafters jutted like human ribs above empty, freezing galleries, and great doors gave onto suites soaked by pitiless rain. Angry spectres, staggering with the faint steps of the insane, paraded arm in arm through the wrecked masonry, sneering as I passed: ‘The Stanilands have no money? Good! Excellent!' \n\nParagraph 5: Lewis' successor as CIO President, Philip Murray, named Brophy the Director of Industrial Union Councils (IUC). He was instrumental in setting up IUCS in cities across the country, viewing them as the \"community organizations of the CIO\" that \"can rally not only the support of all unions in the community, but they can also play a leading part in strengthening progressive sentiment in other unions and outside the organized labor movement.”  Brophy argued that most people shared the goals of the CIO, and asserted that what they lacked was “the leadership that organized labor alone can give…\" His position as Director of IUCs proved to be an important one in the expulsion of CP-led unions from the CIO following World War II. He was one of the strongest advocates for centralized control of the CIO's political action committees and the industrial councils, which were made up from delegates from the more or less autonomous unions affiliated with the CIO but which were themselves creations of the CIO, obliged to follow CIO policy imposed from above. In November–December 1942, he led a team whose report led to formation of the CIO-PAC in July 1943.  In 1948 he led the crackdown on local labor councils and state bodies within the CIO that had endorsed American Labor Party candidate Henry Wallace or opposed the Marshall Plan in contravention of national CIO policy.\n\nParagraph 6: Ards were forced to sell their Castlereagh Park home in 1998 to try to reduce their crippling debts. The stadium remained well tended for another three years while ambitious plans for a new ground further down the road were developed. In 2002 Castlereagh Park was demolished, as planned. Ards hoped to play at a new community-owned site, a stone's throw from Castlereagh Park that was due to be developed in 2010 by the local council. This plan has since been shelved, and they are still the nomads of Northern Irish football. During the time since Ards left Castleragh Park, they have shared football grounds at Cliftonville's Solitude and Carrick Rangers' Taylors Avenue, their rivals Bangor's ground, Clandeboye Park and Ballyclare Comrades' ground, Dixon Park.\n\nParagraph 7: Kohlberg joined Bear Stearns in 1955 where he would go on to manage the corporate finance department.  Working for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kohlberg, alongside Bear Stearns executives began advising a series of what they described as \"bootstrap\" investments.  Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is considered to have been among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals.  Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.  Kravis and his associates created a series of limited partnerships to acquire these various corporations, ones they judged were performing well below their sales and profit potential or where there were untapped financial assets that could be monetized.  In most cases, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co put up ten percent of the acquisition price from its own funds and borrowed the rest from investors by issuing high-yield bonds.\n\nParagraph 8: Game 1 at the HP Pavilion ended in a 2–1 San Jose victory as the Sharks executed a physical forechecking gameplan and outshot the Oilers 30–16. In Game 2, the Sharks entered the ice to a cheer that eclipsed 109 decibels, and they rode their fans' emotion to another slim 2–1 victory. The Sharks had taken a two-game lead in the series, but were now missing Milan Michalek, one of their best offensive forwards. Michalek had been blasted in open ice by Oilers' forward Raffi Torres in Game 2. When the teams returned to Rexall Place for Game 3, the Edmonton crowd exploded; the noise in the building eclipsed 114 decibels as the Oilers came onto the ice. The Oilers parlayed the noise into inspired play, running roughshod all over the ice and outshooting the Sharks 15–2 by the end of the first period. Sharks goaltender Vesa Toskala held tough, however, and the Oilers only took a 1–0 lead into the first intermission. By the third period, the Sharks had taken a 2–1 lead, and it stood until Torres tied the game with a wrist-shot as he came down the wing. The game went into overtime, and the Sharks nearly ended it on a 2-on-1 rush, as Thornton passed to Cheechoo for the shot, but Dwayne Roloson dove across the crease and sniped the puck out of mid-air. The game finally ended in the third overtime, as the Oilers' top line of Horcoff, Hemsky and Smyth worked a passing play into the San Jose crease, where Horcoff jammed the puck in the San Jose goal for the Edmonton win. In Game 4 in Edmonton, the Oilers were trailing 3–2 in the second period when Sergei Samsonov's penalty expired and he was sent in alone on Toskala. To everyone's shock, Toskala came charging out of the net to get the puck before Samsonov. Toskala lost the puck and Samsonov slid a backhand into the open net to tie the game. The Edmonton crowd exploded in delight, and the Oilers never looked back, cruising to a 6–3 win. Game 5 in San Jose was the site of an unfortunate incident: the American feed of the Game 4 broadcast in Edmonton had picked up background noise during the playing of the American National Anthem. San Jose fans had thought it was booing, and in Game 5, a majority of San Jose fans booed the entire Canadian National Anthem. The game itself saw the Oilers carry over the momentum they gained from Game 4, and they struck for three powerplay goals and one shorthanded goal en route to another 6–3 win. In Game 6 in Edmonton, the Edmonton crowd loudly cheered the singing of the American anthem, and then joined anthem singer Paul Lorieau in a throaty and passionate rendition of \"O Canada.\" The Oilers picked up where they had left off in the previous game – they stymied the Sharks' high-scoring forwards and Dwayne Roloson made 24 saves for his first career playoff shutout as the Oilers eliminated the Sharks in six games. The Oilers had earned a trip to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1991–92.\n\nParagraph 9: Prior to any formal prehospital care system in the United States, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and local funeral homes provided \"scoop and run\" transportation services, entirely lacking any resemblance of modern medical care; instead, they provided only the 'run' portion. The PBP commonly utilized their \"paddy waggons\" due to their versatility, and the funeral homes doubled hearses as ambulances to transport the sick and dying to the hospital, and more than likely, later to the funeral home. In 1968, Freedom House Ambulance was born out of an existing organization, Freedom House Enterprises, a nonprofit dedicated to establishing and supporting black-run businesses in the city. Freedom House Ambulance provided emergency care and some rescue services in the City's Hill District and other predominantly black neighborhoods, as the police already covered responses to the rest of the city, composed mostly of affluent white communities. The seemingly \"crazy\" dreams of an anesthesiologist combined with the passion of a philanthropic board member and unwavering dedication of a med-school fellow, would catapult Pittsburgh and Freedom House to the world stage, whether they knew it or not. The work of Doctors Peter Safar, Nancy Caroline, Ron Stewart and Paul Paris, along with that of Mr. Phil Hallen, President of the Maurice Falk Foundation, soon lead to an operation the likes of which the world had never seen; to save countless lives on The Hill and elsewhere, employ young black people and combat racism. Before its demise, Freedom House would eventually become a shining example of prehospital care and the use of paramedics in the field for the rest of the nation and eventually the world to follow. Unfortunately, due to the success of Freedom House, in 1975 Mayor Pete Flaherty decided to terminate funding, thereby essentially gutting the operation, as well as to found a city-wide EMS agency, funded and overseen by the City. Under the strong urging of Freedom House's Medical Director, Dr. Nancy Caroline, the mayor's administration hired the entirety of Freedom House's clinical and operational staff, both paramedics and dispatchers alike. Dr. Caroline managed to strong-arm the City into doing so due to her uniquely qualified position as Medical Director for the new City agency. Moreover, she was certainly the only physician interested in the region, if not the country. Unfortunately Mayor Flaherty's administration had only agreed to hire Freedom House's employees, all of which were black, not to retain them. Through unfair practices and methods, the original Freedom House crews were almost entirely removed from the brand new City operation. Only about 4 to 8 Freedom House medics are believed to have remained on staff with Pittsburgh EMS for more than 10 years, one of which eventually retired as Assistant Chief, being the first black person to hold that rank.\n\nParagraph 10: Many of the Native American warriors came from the Fort Sill Reservation in Indian Territory, confident that they could terrorize Texas and escape to safety across the Red River, which was another legal jurisdiction. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors, approx 180 warriors, under the leadership of Satanta, Satank, Mamanti, Big Tree, White Horse, Fast Bear, Yellow Wolf, and Eagle Heart. Hidden in a thicket of scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, they observed the slow approach of General William Tecumseh Sherman's inspection retinue of approx 18 men.  Although the Kiowa war party outnumbered the  US Army troop by ten to one, they didn't attack, maybe because the Army troopers would have inflicted too many casualties. The Kiowa story is that the previous night, Mamanti (\"He Walking-above\"), the shaman, had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. The braves were rewarded three hours later when 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder trundled into view. The Kiowa attacked and quickly overwhelmed this convoy. Seven muleskinners were killed, while five managed to escape. One of the mule skinners was tortured to death with fire by the Kiowa, his tongue cut out. The Warriors lost three of their own but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. It was well after dark before the white survivors reached the nearby Fort Richardson and told their harrowing tale to the very officer whose party had passed unharmed under the Kiowa guns, William Tecumseh Sherman. General Sherman ordered the arrests of the Indian war chiefs at Fort Sill.  Satank was killed in the train as he tried to escape the column of United States soldiers. The rest were tried in the first Indian trial in history. Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. They were paroled two years later thanks to the steady behavior adopted by Guipago in his dealing with the government agents, and were sent back to their people."}

He was capable of playing almost every wind instrument, and he planned amateur music performances with his friends and colleagues.  In 1899, Pearl attended the University of Michigan where he received his PhD in zoology for his work on the behavior of planarians.  He also was involved in studying the variation of fish for the Biological Survey of the Great Lakes.  While working in a zoological laboratory, he met his future wife, Maude M. De Witt.  In 1903, they married, and together in 1905 and 1906, they traveled abroad and worked at the University of London, University of Leipzig, and Marine Biological Station in Naples.\n\nParagraph 7: The ephemeral nature of certain artistic expressions is above all a subjective concept subject to the very definition of art, a controversial term open to multiple meanings, which have oscillated and evolved over time and geographic space, since the term \"art\" has not been understood in the same way in all times and places. Art is a component of culture, reflecting in its conception the economic and social substrates, and the transmission of ideas and values, inherent in any human culture across space and time. However, the definition of art is open, subjective, debatable; there is no unanimous agreement among historians, Philosophers or Artists. In classical Greco-Roman antiquity, one of the main cradles of Western civilisation and the first culture to reflect on art, art was considered to be a human ability in any productive field, practically a synonym for \"skill\". In the 2nd century Galen divided art into liberal arts and vulgar arts, according to whether they had an intellectual or manual origin. The liberal arts included grammar, rhetoric and dialectics – which formed the trivium – and arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music – which formed the quadrivium; the vulgar arts included architecture, sculpture and painting, but also other activities that are nowadays considered Crafts. In the 16th century, architecture, painting and sculpture began to be seen as activities that required not only craft and skill, but also a kind of intellectual conception that made them superior to other kinds of crafts. Thus was born the modern concept of art, which during the Renaissance acquired the name of arti del disegno (arts of design), since it was understood that this activity – designing – was the main activity in the genesis of works of art. Later, expressions such as music, poetry and dance were considered artistic activities, and in 1746 Charles Batteux established in The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle the current conception of Fine arts, a term that has become successful and has survived to the present day. However, attempts to establish some basic criteria as to which expressions can be considered art and which cannot have been somewhat unsuccessful, producing in a way the opposite effect and accentuating even more the lack of definition of art, which today is an open and interpretable concept, where many formulas and conceptions fit, although a minimum common denominator based on aesthetic and expressive qualities, as well as a component of creativity, is generally accepted. Currently, to the traditional classification of the arts, certain critics and historians have added expressions such as photography, cinematography, comics, theatre, television, fashion, advertising, animation, Video games, etc., and there is still some disagreement about other types of expressive activities.\n\nParagraph 8: After receiving a mystical vision of a lily eaten by a horse, which he recognized as indicating that the cares of his worldly life (the draft horse pulling a plough) were swallowing up his spiritual life (the lily, a symbol of purity), he decided to devote himself entirely to the contemplative life. In 1467, he left his wife and his ten children with her consent rescinded all his political duties and aimed to join a mystic brotherhood near Basel. A few miles away in Waldenburg, he saw three visions that made him understand his aim was not the one of gods and made him return towards the Melchtal, near his former home as he didn't dare to return home. Discovered a few days after his arrival by some hunters, he eventually set himself up a hermit in the Ranft chine in Switzerland, establishing a chantry for a priest from his own funds so that he could assist at mass daily. Having arrived in the Ranft, he began to fast and after having received the consent of Oswald Yssner, the priest in Kerns he didn't eat anymore. Upon Yssner’s doubt and insistence for a clarification, Niklaus explained that he only from assisting a mass in which a priest enjoys the sacramental bread, received enough nourishment. Symbolic visions continued to be a feature of his contemplation, and he became a spiritual guide whose advice was widely sought and followed. His reputation for wisdom and piety was such that notables and clergy from across Europe came to seek advice from him. The Benedictine abbot of Sponheim Johannes Trithemius convinced by the reports he heard from people who met Niklaus, compared him with Saint Anthony. In 1470, Pope Paul II granted the first indulgence to the sanctuary at Ranft and it became a pilgrimage site on the Way of Saint James, a pilgrims' route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. His counsel prevented a civil war between the cantons meeting at the Diet of Stans in 1481, when their antagonism grew. Despite being illiterate and having limited experience with the world, he is honored among both Protestants and Catholics with the permanent national unity of Switzerland. The Archduke Sigismund sent him a gilded chalice in 1473 and 100 Guilders in 1481. Letters of thanks to him from Berne and Soleure still survive. When he died, on 21 March 1487, he was surrounded by his wife and children.\n\nParagraph 9: In February 2022 Shortall, who is the Social Democrats' spokesperson for Health, introduced a bill in the Dáil to stop the practice of the HSE sending debt collectors to cancer patients in search of payment. The Bill also seeks an end to an inpatient charge of €80 per visit for chemo and radiotherapy, and also seeks to end extortionate parking fees. The government choose not to oppose the bill. Shortall opined that it was “frankly disgusting” that cancer patients were being pursued by debt collectors during one of the most difficult points in their lives. Each of the other opposition parties all praised the content of the bill and similarly expressed their dismay at the idea of debt collectors being used on cancer patients.\n\nParagraph 10: John Adrian Shepherd-Barron was born on 23 June 1925 in Shillong (now Meghalaya), India, to British parents. His Scottish father, Wilfred Shepherd-Barron, was chief engineer of the Chittagong Port Commissioners in North Bengal, which was then part of the British Empire, then later Chief Engineer of the Port of London Authority, before becoming president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, whilst his mother Dorothy, was an Olympic tennis player and Wimbledon ladies doubles champion. He was educated at Stowe School, the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge (from where he dropped out before successfully finishing the first year in Economics). During World War II, he was commissioned into the Airborne Forces, serving with the 159th Parachute Light Regiment."}

Osamu Tezuka and his publishing company Mushi Production created COM in reaction to the alternative manga magazine Garo's popularity, which at that time was around its highest circulation. Tezuka himself was a crossroads with his work, shifting to darker themes influenced by gekiga, targeting the readers who had grown up with his work and were interested in more mature narratives. He wanted to create a forum for manga artists to publish manga with experimental forms that would not be accepted in the commercial manga industry. The title of the magazine should stand for \"Comics, Community and Communication\". In a statement published in the first issue of the magazine, Tezuka explained: \"It is said that now is the golden age of manga. So shouldn't works of outstanding quality be published? Or isn't the real situation one in which many manga artists are being worked to death, while they are forced into submission, servitude and cooperation with the cruel requirements of commercialism?\" The magazine is considered to be one of the only non-commercial alternative to weekly manga mazines besides Garo, before offset printing became widely available in the early 1970s.\n\nParagraph 3: Imperial Teen first gained notice with its debut album, Seasick, in 1996, which was produced by Steve McDonald (Redd Kross).

The earlier practice, of identifying a single set of target families for all developmental programmes, has been done away with. This was partly necessitated by an interim stay order given by the Supreme Court for 10th and 11th five year plans. The trend is now increasingly to have development schemes run on the principle of universalisation or saturation or self-selection. This means following a priority list for each scheme, rather than following a single list of identified families for all schemes. For example, the people who put in manual work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act need not belong to families below the poverty line. Whoever is within the specified age bracket and is willing to get enrolled, can get covered. Similarly, the beneficiaries under National Food Security Act are identified by the State/UT Governments, with the ceiling/ coverage under TPDS determined for each State/UT by the central Government. This list of families can be different from the priority list used for rural housing programmes under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Grameen), which runs on the basis of whether a person has or does not have a pucca house, based on SECC survey of 2011. Similarly, the rural electrification programme Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana had the concept of below poverty line families. But the new approach of Soubhagya scheme is to make no discrimination based on the poverty line, but to go on the basis of households that do not have electricity connection. In the maternity benefit scheme renamed as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, there is automatic and universal coverage, without any mention of whether a pregnant woman is below the poverty line or not. ( See Ministry of Women and Child Development at http://www.wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/PMMVY%20Scheme%20Implemetation%20Guidelines%20._0.pdf) However, there is still lack of clarity on fully integrating SECC data of 2011 with old age pension/ widow pension/ disability pension schemes. This is because the guidelines of National Social Assistance Programme still speak about list of families below the poverty line. (See http://nsap.nic.in/Guidelines/nsap_guidelines_oct2014.pdf) Thus, by and large, the present position is that while SECC database of 2011 provides a basic skeleton, each developmental scheme is now run independently based on the necessity, rather than getting bogged down to one single list of targeted families.\n\nParagraph 7: Javier Álvarez, a Mexican composer, named one of his compositions after the metro station. Álvarez first created \"Canción de tierra y esperanza\" (English: \"Song of Earth and Hope\"), which he dedicated to his parents for Christmas 1986. In 1990, the metro system allowed Marco Límenes, a Mexican artist, to exhibit his kinetic sculptures in the station. Límenes asked Álvarez to use the composition during the exhibition. Álvarez, instead, recomposed the work and renamed it \"Metro Chabacano\". He requested the Cuarteto Latinoamericano to play and record it. The composition is a string quartet that has an average tempo of 144 to 146 beats per minute. According to Álvarez, it has \"a continuous eight-note movement of moderately driving speed from which short melodic solos emerge for each instrument [...] although the piece is brief and in single movement, the rhythms, accents and melodic fragments that emerge from the perpetual motion background are intricately playful\". Jacques Sagot wrote for La Nación that the composition converges with the pace of the station, at first with an \"uninterrupted flow of repeated notes\" and then with \"whistles of the violin [evoking] the braking of the machine, the squeaking of the rubber [with] the arrival of the metro train\". The Cuarteto Latinoamericano played the composition live at the inauguration of the exhibition in September 1991 and Álvarez subsequently adopted it as a string orchestra composition.\n\nParagraph 8: Mammalian orthoreovirus virions are non-enveloped with icosahedral symmetry created by a double-layered capsid reaching about 80 nm wide. Each capsid contains 10 segments of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. The inner capsid or core particle (T=2) contains five different proteins: σ2, λ1, λ2, λ3, and μ2 and is approximately 70 nm in diameter. One hundred and twenty copies of the λ1 protein arranged in 12 decameric units make up the shell of the inner capsid structure. This shell is stabilized by one hundred and fifty copies of the σ2 protein that 'clamp'  adjacent λ1 monomers together. At the 12 five-fold axes of symmetry, pentamers of the λ2 protein form turret-like structures that protrudes from the surface of the shell. In the center of the λ2 turret a channel allows viral mRNAs to be extruded during transcription. The channel is 70Å at its base and 15Å at its narrowest point.  The core also contains within it twelve copies of λ3, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. One λ3 protein is found slightly offset from each of the twelve pentameric λ2 turrets. Closely associated with λ3 are one or two copies of μ2, a transcriptase cofactor. μ2 has been found to have some enzymatic functions, such as NTPase activity. The λ3 protein is responsible for transcription of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. Each transcript is threaded through the λ2 pentameric turret as it is being extruded. Guanylyltransferase enzymatic activity in the λ2 turret adds a 5' guanosine cap to the extruded mRNA. In addition, two methyltransferase domains found in the λ2 structure act to methylate the 7N position of the added guanosine and the 2' O of the first templated nucleotide, which in all cases is also a guanosine. The outer capsid (T=13) is composed of μ1 and σ3 proteins with λ2, in compound with σ1, interspersed around the capsid. It has been proposed that λ2 is involved in replication due to its placement at the fivefold axes and its ability to interact with λ3 in solution. σ1, a filamentous trimer extruding from the outer capsid,  is responsible for cell attachment by interacting with sialic acid and other entry receptors. μ1 and σ3 are both involved in the attachment and thus entry of the virus via receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the formation of clathrin-coated pits.\n\nParagraph 9: Cheyenne ledger books include:Abbott Ledger (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne);  Arrow's Elk Society Ledger (Cheyenne, Southern Cheyenne);  Bear's Heart Ledger Book (Southern Tsisistas/Cheyenne) 24 drawings in graphite and crayon signed by the artist, c. 1875/1876;  Bethel Moore Custer Ledger (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne), c. 1881;  Black Horse Ledger (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne), c. 1877-1879;  Cheyenne Bowstring Warrior Society (Cheyenne, Southern Cheyenne), pencil, colored pencil, c. 1850s;  Coe-Cheyenne Ledger (Cheyenne, Southern Cheyenne);  Dunham Album (Cheyenne, Southern Cheyenne), pencil and colored pencil;  Ewers Ledger (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne), pencil and colored pencil; Frank Henderson Ledger (Southern Inuaina and/or Southern Tsistisistas), c. 1882;  Keeling Ledger (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne), 115 drawings in pencil and colored pencil;  Little Shield Ledger–Schøyen (Cheyenne, Northern Cheyenne), a significant pictographic source for the Platte River Indian war.

His preceptor gave him the Buddhist name  “Inthapanyo” which means “The wise one”. He was a Mahanikaya monk and graduated at the third level of Dharma studies in his hometown and in Pali language studies at the third level in Bangkok. After he finished learning the Pali language, he realized that living in Bangkok was not suitable for him because monks and people there did not practice to achieve the heart and core of Buddhism. So he decided to go back to Surat Thani and practice rigorously and taught people to practice well according the core the teaching of the Buddha. Then he established Suanmokkhabālārama (The Grove of the Power of Liberation) in 1932 which is the mountain and forest for 118.61 acres at Pum Riang, Chaiya district, Surat Thani Thailand. It is a forest Dhamma and Vipassana meditation center. In 1989, he founded The Suan Mokkh International Dharma Hermitage for international Vipassana meditation practitioners around the world. There is a 10-day silent meditation retreat that starts on the 1st of each month for the whole year which is free, of no charge for international practitioners who are interested in practicing meditation. He was a central monk in the popularization of the Thai Forest Tradition in the South of Thailand. He was a great Dhamma author because he wrote so many Dhamma books that we have well known: Handbook for Mankind, Heart-wood from the Bo Tree, Keys to Natural Truth, Me and Mine, Mindfulness of Breathing and The A, B, Cs of Buddhism etc. On October 20, 2005, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced praise to “Buddhadasa Bhikkhu”, an important person in the world and celebrated the 100th anniversary on May 27, 2006. They held an academic activity to disseminate the Buddhist principles that Ajahn Buddhadasa had taught people around the world. So, he was the practitioner of a great Thai Forest Tradition who practiced well and spread Dhammas for people around the world to realize the core and heart of Buddhism."}
{"queries": ["The text discusses the career of Bishop Urban and his pursuit of a legal case against the dioceses of St Davids and Hereford. The case began with complaints against St Davids before the death of Bishop Wilfrid in 1115. Urban presented a petition to Pope Calixtus II asserting the primacy of Llandaff over other Welsh dioceses and alleging persecution by Welsh and Norman magnates. The pope issued protections for Urban and papal letters in his support. The case was then referred to Rome in 1127, and Urban traveled there in 1128. Pope Honorius II provisionally ruled in Urban's favor, granting territory to Llandaff diocese. However, the archbishop of Canterbury's involvement was criticized. Another hearing in Rome in 1129 resulted in Urban winning by default since the other parties did not appear. The bishop of St Davids appealed the decision in 1130. Urban's claims faced obstacles at the royal court and Canterbury, and Pope Innocent II was less helpful. The case was ultimately settled by the Anglo-Norman archbishops in England in 1133, and Urban lost. He made a final journey to Rome and died in 1134. Despite losing, Urban's efforts changed the relationship between the papal curia and the church in England, leading to more appeals to Rome from English provincial courts.", "The text discusses the relationship between compositionality and semantic holism in philosophy of language. Compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expression depends on the meaning of its parts and its mode of composition, while holism argues that the meaning of expressions is determined by their relations with other expressions in the language as a whole. Peter Pagin identifies three points of incompatibility between these two ideas, including the fact that compositionality suggests the meaning of the parts precedes the whole, while holism suggests the opposite. Pagin also explores the implications of inferential role semantics, a holistic theory of meaning, which suggests that every accepted inference involving an expression becomes part of its meaning. The text raises questions about the compatibility of compositionality and holism and challenges the inevitable consequences of accepting a holistic theory of meaning.", "Teo Castellanos is a versatile artist who works in theater, film, and television.

The preceding extra point was blocked by Pitt and the Falcons took the lead of 20–14.  Early in the fourth quarter the Bowling Green defense caused Pitt's third fumble and seemed to return it to the end zone for an apparent game-winning touchdown, but due to an inadvertent whistle, Bowling Green was stripped of the touchdown, but still took over possession of the ball at Pitt's 11-yard line.

The Falcons improved to 1–0 on the season and had their second consecutive season opening victory over a BCS Conference opponent (having defeated Minnesota 32–31 in overtime the year before), although being outgained by the Pitt offense 393–254.  Sheehan lead the Falcons in the passing game completing 24 of 40 attempts for 163 yards, 1 touchdown, and an interception, followed by Barnes who was 2 of 2 for 27 yards and a touchdown.  The Falcons' running game was led by Chris Bullock who had 7 rushes for 44 yards, followed by Turner and Sheehan who each had a rushing touchdown.  Bullock also led the receivers with 7 receptions for 49 yards along with Scheidler who had 3 receptions for 30 yards and two touchdowns.  Jamal Brown led the Falcons defense with 14 tackles, followed by Antonio Smith's 12.  Smith, Lewis, and Enrique Dozier each forced fumbles, with Lewis, Dozier, and Angelo Magnone each recovering a fumble and Lewis snagging the lone interception for the Falcons defense.  The Falcons were able to sack Stull four times, twice by Bronko Nagurski Trophy candidate Diyral Briggs and once each by Smith and Dozier.\n\nParagraph 2: The relationship between compositionality and semantic holism has also been of interest to many philosophers of language. On the surface it would seem that these two ideas are in complete and irremediable contradiction. Compositionality is the principle that states that the meaning of a complex expression depends on the meaning of its parts and on its mode of composition. As stated before, holism, on the other hand, is the thesis that the meanings of expressions of a language are determined by their relations with the other expressions of the language as a whole. Peter Pagin, in an essay called Are Compositionality and Holism Compatible identifies three points of incompatibility between these two hypotheses. The first consists in the simple observation that while, for holism, the meaning of the whole would seem to precede that of its parts in terms of priority, for compositionality, the reverse is true, the meaning of the parts precedes that of the whole. The second incoherence consists in the fact that a necessity to attribute \"strange\" meanings to the components of larger expressions would apparently result from any attempt to reconcile compositionality and holism. Pagin takes a specific holistic theory of meaning – inferential role semantics, the theory according to which the meaning of an expression is determined by the inferences that it involves – as his paradigm of holism. If we interpret this theory holistically, the result will be that every accepted inference that involves some expression will enter into the meaning of that expression. Suppose, for example, that Fred believes that \"Brown cows are dangerous\". That is, he accepts the inference from \"brown cows\" to \"dangerous.\" This entails that this inference is now part of the meaning of \"brown cow.\" According to compositionality then, \"cow implies dangerous\" and \"brown implies dangerous\" are both true because they are the constituents of the expression \"brown cow.\" But is this really an inevitable consequence of the acceptance of the holism of inferential role semantics? To see why it's not assume the existence of a relation of inference I between two expressions x and y and that the relation applies just in case F accepts the inference from x to y.  Suppose that in the extension of I, there are the following pairs of expressions (\"The sky is blue and leaves are green\", \"the sky is blue\") and (\"brown cow\", \"dangerous\").\n\nParagraph 3: With Spann missing in the chaos, Tyson escaped to the northern and more secure part of the fortress, where he was trapped with a television crew from the German ARD network. He borrowed their satellite phone, and called his wife Rosann at their home in Tashkent. He told her: “Rose, listen. There are people dead. Some of our friends are dead.” Rosann Tyson dropped the phone but then picked it up and grabbed a piece of paper, knowing her husband's life might well rest on her getting the message right. David Tyson said: \"I’m in Qala-i Jangi.\" Rosann Tyson had never heard the name of the fort. She wrote down: \"Koala Jan Gi.\" Tyson then called the U.S. embassy in Uzbekistan and spoke to Major Mike Davison, a United States Air Force (USAF) officer, and requested no air support due to the proximity of allied Afghan forces. A 15-man rescue force was sent from the Turkish school, a base in Mazar-e-Sharif, housing Green Berets and an eight-man team from Z Squadron Special Boat Service. The rescue force was assembled hastily and contained a headquarters element from 3rd Battalion 5th Special Forces Group, a pair of USAF liaison officers, a CIA medic called Glenn and the SBS team. The Afghans also brought reinforcements: their personnel and a T-55 tank entered the compound and started firing into the prisoner-controlled area. Several other television crews arrived on the scene of the battle, ensuring it got wide media coverage; the successive stages of the fighting were filmed extensively, providing rare footage of special forces units in combat. At 14:00, a mixed special ops team, formed with nine U.S. Army Special Forces and eight British Special Boat Service operators, one of them was U.S. Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Stephen Bass, arrived and joined the Afghans firing at the prisoners from the northern part of the fort. From 16:00 until nightfall, despite Tyson's requests, they directed two U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet for nine 500-pound GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs against the entrenched prisoners, who continued to put up fierce resistance and were dropped on the armory, which was serving as a base of fire for the prisoners. He, German journalist Arnim Stauth and others fled just before dusk. Navy SEAL Stephen Bass then advanced to the western tower of the fort and spotted what appeared to be the body of Spann. The SEAL fired rounds next to the legs of the body to see if it would flinch, indicating life. There was no movement from the body. For his actions, Bass received the Navy Cross.\n\nParagraph 4: By mid-May, the Ratchaprasong protest site camp was surrounded by armoured vehicles and snipers were positioned in case they were needed. On the evening of 13 May, General Khattiya Sawasdiphol (\"Seh Daeng\"), security advisor to the protesters and leader of the armed \"Ronin\" guards known as the black shirts, was shot in the head by a sniper's bullet while he was giving an interview to press. It is unclear who fired the shot; speculation was it was ordered either by the army, by Thaksin to keep him quiet, or was simply a stray bullet. Thereafter, a state of emergency was expanded to 17 provinces and the military cracked down, dubbed by the Thai media as \"savage May\" (). An additional 41 civilians were killed (including one Italian journalist) and more than 250 were injured by 20:30, including soldiers. One military death was attributed to friendly fire. The government claimed that the civilians killed were either armed terrorists or were shot by terrorists, and insisted that some civilians were shot by terrorists disguised in army uniforms. The military declared the area a \"free-fire zone\", in which anybody, be they protester, resident, tourist or journalist would be shot on sight, with medics banned from entering. On 14 May, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon encouraged protesters and the government to reopen talks. On 16 May, UDD leaders said again they were ready for talks as long as the military pulled back, but the government demanded the unconditional dispersal of the protesters. A state of emergency was declared in five northeastern provinces on 16 May. The government rejected a Senate call for a ceasefire and Senate-mediated negotiations. On 17 May, Amnesty International called for the military to stop using live ammunition. Armored vehicles led the final assault into Ratchaprasong in the early morning of 19 May, killing at least five, including an Italian journalist. Soldiers were reported to have fired on medical staff who went to the aid of the shooting victims. By 13:30, UDD leaders surrendered to police and told protesters to give themselves up. Dozens of arson attacks soon broke out nationwide on Red Shirt targets including the CentralWorld building, various banks and civic buildings and government buildings. People arrested and charged for arson included a number of Red Shirt supporters. A curfew was declared and troops were authorised to shoot on sight anybody inciting unrest. An undisclosed number of arrests and detentions occurred. Fifty-one protesters remained missing as of 8 June. The government claimed the protests cost 150 billion baht (approximately US$5 billion) to organise.\n\nParagraph 5: The most remarkable and long-lasting legacy of Bishop Urban's career was the epic case he pursued at Rome against the neighbouring dioceses of St Davids and Hereford.  The first complaints against St Davids had been made before the death of Bishop Wilfrid of St Davids (1115).  It may have been that which inspired the collection of documents copied into the Book of Llandaff.  The wider case opened at the Council of Reims in 1119 when Urban presented a petition to Pope Calixtus II, where he asserted the primacy of Llandaff over other Welsh dioceses, the persecution of his church by Welsh and Norman magnates and the depredations on his jurisdiction by neighbouring bishops.  Urban received protections from the pope and the extent of his claims were registered.  Papal letters were issued to King Henry I, Ralph archbishop of Canterbury and the clergy and barons of the diocese in Urban's support.  In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate, summoned the disputing parties to London to hear the case.  The case was finally referred to Rome in 1127, and Urban travelled there in April 1128.  Pope Honorius II decided provisionally in Urban's favour awarding substantial swathes of territory in Herefordshire and Deheubarth to Llandaff diocese.  The archbishop of Canterbury's part in the affair was criticised by the curia.  A further hearing at Rome in February 1129 heard the evidence of Welsh clergy and witnesses Urban had brought with him.  Since the other parties did not appear, the case went to Urban by default.  This brought the bishop of St Davids to Rome in 1130 to appeal against the decision.  Urban's claims were increasingly obstructed both at the royal court and Canterbury. He found Pope Innocent II less helpful than his predecessors, when he met him at St-Quentin in 1131.  In 1132, the pope referred the case to the archbishops of the Anglo-Norman realm for settlement, though reserving the final judgement to himself.  Urban fought the case through several hearings in England in 1132 and 1133, and ultimately lost.  Ill and aged now, Urban made a final journey to Rome, where he died early in October 1134.  Though he lost, Urban's ambitions and energy radically changed the nature of the relationship between the papal curia and the church in England.  Following Urban's epic legal battle, an increasing number of litigants appealed to Rome from decisions taken in English provincial courts.\n\nParagraph 6: In a review for The Boston Phoenix, Michael Christopher speculated that the album would be received poorly by those who refuse to recognize the Misfits as legitimate without Glenn Danzig. \"The problem is, and has always been, that it just isn't the Misfits without Glenn Danzig at the helm\", he elaborated in the Delaware County Daily Times, \"[Only] retains the name in rights only, because there is no true legitimacy left within the group, which has featured a revolving door of backup players.\" \"That's a shame, because The Devil's Rain is chock full of good, campy horror business.\" He gave the album a mixed review in both publications, praising some tracks while criticizing others: Unexplained', 'Vivid Red', and 'Sleepwalkin' ' are fun and frightfully ferocious. Other points are stumbles: 'Monkey's Paw' has Only trying pitifully hard to ape the Misfits' 'Last Caress', and tracks like 'Curse of the Mummy's Hand' and 'Ghost of Frankenstein' are too predictable to be more than schlock, though it would be funny—in a good, goofy, send-up sort of way—if it was done under another moniker ... These guys just need another alias.\" Gentile expressed similar sentiments, complementing Only's bass and Cadena's guitar playing but saying that the group's choice to continue under the Misfits name seemed to limit their choice of subject matter: \"while the band has technical chops, it almost seems like they are singing about the occult and undead merely because that's what the Misfits are supposed to do. When original vocalist Glenn Danzig detailed 'the insemination of little girls in the middle of wet dreams', it seemed like that was something he was actually into. Even when second Misfits vocalist, Michael Graves, wailed that he was 'crying on a Saturday night', it seemed he was pulling from true early 20s dejection. But, when Only sings about mummies, or Frankenstein, or even hell, it doesn't seem like that's what he feels is important, but what he is limited to in subject matter, leaving the tunes without any sense of conviction.\" He did note that \"when the band does become most alive is when they play the style of music that excites them\", citing Only's doo-wop style in \"The Black Hole\" as an example. \"The Devil's Rain certainly isn't a disgrace\", he concluded, \"and long-running fans will find at least a few things to enjoy about the album. It's just frustrating that when the band snaps together and plays what they truly want to play, they aren't so much 'the Misfits' as a band containing a hefty amount of punk talent and experience. Instead of leaving the past behind, they seem to cling to it, forever condemning themselves to comparisons of previous incarnations.\" Lymangrover opined similarly, saying the album \"suffers from the fact that the group never tries to expand on the vocabulary established 30 years ago. If Famous Monsters was a step back for the Misfits legacy, this is a bigger step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nParagraph 7: Julie is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. Casting director Jan Russ was tasked with finding the actors to play the original cast, with the majority chosen for their comedic skills. Vikki Blanche was cast as Julie when she was 18. She had graduated from the National Theatre drama school in November 1984 and was cast the following month. Blanche did not think she would win the role so soon after leaving school, so she \"clowned around\" at the audition. She stated \"I always thought I would have to work my way up in this industry, so I didn't really take the audition very seriously. I had an idea for a character floating around in the back of my head, so I decided to combine it with what I'd been told about Julie – and went completely over the top!\" Blanche began filming for the serial at the HSV-7 studios in Melbourne on 2 January 1985. She admitted that accepting the breakthrough role of Julie meant \"a lot of thinking and decision-making\" beforehand. She explained \"People assume you just jump at a chance like that, but in a way it's a worry. I felt I was being thrown in at the deep end. I wasn't that thrilled at first. I've seen so many go into series, then I never saw them again.\" However, she expressed her hope that the role would be long-term, as she enjoyed her character and working with the show's cast and crew. Blanche also said that due to her workload, she had lost touch with her drama school friends and her social life was non-existent outside of those she worked with. She added \"After playing a character all the week I just want to stop and catch up with myself at weekends.\" Blanche made her debut appearance in the show's first episode, broadcast on 18 March 1985.\n\nParagraph 8: Coached at the Ipswich Jets by Australian former international  Tommy Raudonikis, Langer was playing first grade when he was only 17 in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership by 1986. He played as a  for Ipswich and in 1987 opposed his older brother Kevin, who was  of Wests. That year his selection from left field for the Wayne Bennett-coached Queensland side in the 1987 State of Origin series was questioned by several key figures in the Maroons camp who called for the selection in-form Eastern Suburbs  Laurie Spina. It was Raudonikis who stood up for him, backing Langer's selection and he made his Queensland début in the 1987 State of Origin series while still playing for the Jets. Paul Vautin claimed in his autobiography that during a team meeting, Bennett kept going on about where they were going to hide Langer in defense. He was upset that no-one was defending him against Bennett's comments and so stood up and said \"He's a Queenslander and won't let us down\". Langer's superb performance, including a man-of-the-match award in the decider, silenced the critics and saw him signed on with the newly established Brisbane Broncos team who would enter the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1988.\n\nParagraph 9: Bhutto was born on 29 May 1982 to Murtaza Bhutto and an Afghan mother, Fauzia Fasihudin Bhutto, the daughter of Afghanistan's former foreign affairs official in Kabul. Her father was in exile during the military regime of general Zia-ul-Haq. Her parents divorced when she was three years old and her father took Bhutto with him moving from country to country and she grew up effectively stateless. Her father met Ghinwa Bhutto, a Lebanese ballet teacher in 1989 during his exile in Syria and they married. Bhutto considers Ghinwa as her real mother. Her half-brother Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr. is an artist based in San Francisco.\n\nParagraph 10: Born in Puerto Rico and raised in Miami, Teo Castellanos is an actor/writer/director who works in theater, film and television. Teo received his B.F.A. in Theater from Florida Atlantic University under a full scholarship where he studied with four time Tony Award winner Zoe Caldwell.  He is author of War, Revolution, and the Projects, a one-man trilogy, which he has toured on the East Coast, as well as his one-man show NE 2nd Avenue based on Miami characters, which was commissioned and produced by Miami Light Project as part of their 2001-2002 Contemporary Performance Series and went on to be produced by Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami. Teo Castellanos’ NE 2nd Avenue was awarded the International Cultural Exchange Grant by Miami-Dade County Cultural Affairs, which allowed Teo to bring it to the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it won the Fringe First Award, the most prestigious theater award of the festival (past winners include Emma Thompson, Rowan Atkinson and Danny Hoch).  It was also nominated for a South Florida Carbonell Award for Best New Work and was awarded Best Solo Performance by Miami New Times, and Best Original Play by Miami Beach Sun Post and has toured throughout the U.S and Europe.  City Link Magazine also awarded Teo Playwright of the Year 2006. Teo has lectured and taught theater workshops at Temple University, University of Massachusetts, Saint Michaels College, Santa Fe College, University of South Florida, Florida Memorial University and Miami- Dade College as well as throughout several states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

{"queries": ["The armed forces in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) were initially formed in 1949 as an internal security force to assist the police during strikes and riots. However, after an attempted coup in 1962, the armed forces faced significant cuts in funding, recruitment, and joint operations, leaving them ill-prepared for a large-scale insurrection. By 1970, the armed forces had a limited budget and outdated weaponry. The Ceylon Army consisted of three infantry regiments armed mostly with World War II-era weapons. The Royal Ceylon Navy had only one frigate and a few coastal motor boats, while the Royal Ceylon Air Force had limited numbers of aircraft and mothballed jet trainers. Overall, the armed forces lacked modern weaponry, tanks, field artillery, and ammunition stocks for sustained combat operations.", "The text discusses the book \"The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror\" by Cathy Young Cole. The book examines the concept of victimhood in American politics and argues that it is often used as a tool by the political establishment to shift blame for failures onto specific groups of people. Cole explores the competing claims of victimhood in contemporary American politics, focusing on issues such as welfare, feminism, racism, and the War on Terror. She highlights how the notion of victimhood can create conflicts and tensions between different social groups. Cole also discusses the conflict between the idea of victimhood and the dominant American political culture, which values individualism and often dismisses claims of victimhood as undeserving. She analyzes the use of anti-victimhood rhetoric by certain figures to discredit those claiming to be victims, as well as the rejection of victimhood by some feminists who see it as a tactic to gain power. The study of victimhood has implications for understanding American politics from the 1960s onwards, particularly in relation to multiculturalism, identity politics, and feminism. The book also explores the use of victimhood rhetoric in shaping policies related to civil and criminal justice reform and the welfare state. Additionally, the author has written about the political use of victimhood and vulnerability in peer-reviewed journal articles.", "On October 27, 1473, a commission was given to a group of knights and individuals in Cornwall to gather a force of the king's subjects in order to defeat John, the former Earl of Oxford, and other rebels who had taken control of St. Michael's Mount. The commission also stated that the mount should be returned to the king's control and arrangements should be made for its protection and defense."], "answers": ["Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 2"], "context": "Paragraph 1: McMurray's entry into Cup racing did not go as planned. McMurray was scheduled to drive a limited schedule in a No. 42 Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge in 2002, in preparation for a full-time 2003 rookie of the year campaign in the No. 42 with new sponsor Texaco/Havoline. However, he was instead tapped as interim replacement for injured Ganassi Cup driver Sterling Marlin, who fractured a vertebra in a crash at Kansas Speedway. Thus, McMurray made his Cup debut in the No. 40 Coors Light Dodge at Talladega. One week later, at Charlotte, in just his second career NASCAR Winston Cup and first non-restrictor plate start, McMurray outraced the Joe Gibbs Racing Pontiacs of Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart to win the UAW-GM Quality 500. McMurray had been consistent the entire night, and led 96 of the final 100 laps to score the win. It is considered one of the biggest upsets in NASCAR history. This win set a modern-era record for fewest starts before a win (which has since been tied only by Trevor Bayne in the 2011 Daytona 500), and it was also the first time a driver won in their first start at a 1.5-mile track. McMurray drove for six of the remaining seven races, except for the Old Dominion 500 at Martinsville, with Mike Bliss driving as scheduled in the No. 40.\n\nParagraph 2: On 27 October 1473 Commission to John Arundell, knight, John Colshyll, knight, Robert Willoughby, knight, John Crocker, knight, John Fortescue, Henry Bodrugan, John Sturgeon, Thomas Whalisburgh, John Trenowith, Thomas Trefrye, John Arundell, John Tremayne, John Carmynowe Richard Eggecombe, John Devyok, Oliver Wyse, Edward Assheton, John Pentyre, John Moyle, William TreTenoar, John Penpons, John Wydeslade the younger and William Horde to array the king's lieges of the county of Cornwall, and of other counties adjacent if necessary, to conquer John, late earl of Oxford, and. other rebels who have entered St. Michael's Mount, CO. Cornwall, and to bring back the mount into the king's hands and provide for its safe-custody and defence.\n\nParagraph 3: Although Hinduism is a little-practiced religion in China, it had a significant, but indirect role in influencing Chinese culture through Buddhist beliefs, practices and traditions (which share a common Dharmic root with Hinduism) which diffused and spread to China from India from the 1st or 2nd century CE onwards. During this influence and synthesis of ideas, some terms were mapped into pre-existing concepts - raksasas as luocha, others terms were introduced - pisacas in Hinduism as pishezuo in Chinese. As a result, traces of Hinduism's influence on Chinese culture can be found in Chinese Buddhism, which has syncretized many Hindu deities within its pantheon. One example is the Chinese Buddhist belief in the Twenty-Four Devas, a grouping of protective dharmapalas of Buddhism. Twenty-one of the devas in the group consists of deities borrowed from Hinduism, including, but not limited to, Dàzìzàitiān (Shiva), Dìshìtiān (Indra), Dàfàntiān (Brahma), Jíxiáng Tiānnǚ (Lakshmi), Biàncáitiān (Saraswati) and Yánmóluówáng (Yama). Statues of the Twenty-Four Devas are enshrined in many Chinese Buddhist temples and monasteries, usually in the Mahavira Hall. Aside from the deities, other beings from Hinduism are also shared in Chinese Buddhist belief, such as the Eight Legions of Devas and Nāgas (Chinese: 天龍八部; Pinyin: Tiānlóngbābù) which includes beings like asuras, mahoragas and kinnaras. Yakshas (Chinese: 夜叉; Pinyin: Yèchā) originally from Hinduism, are a class of nature ghosts or demons in Chinese Buddhism. Belief in the Yaksha made its way to China through the Lotus Sutra, which was originally translated into Chinese by Dharmaraksa around 290 CE, before being superseded by a translation in seven fascicles by Kumārajīva in 406 CE. Garuda, the mount of Vishnu, is also well known as Jiālóuluó (Chinese: 迦楼羅; Pinyin: Jiālóuluó) or The Golden Winged Great Peng (Chinese: 金翅大鵬雕; Pinyin: Jīnchì Dàpéng Diāo). Rakshasas (Chinese: 羅剎; Pinyin: Luóchà) are also well known in Chinese communities as human-eating demons or ghosts. For example, Princess Iron Fan, a demonic antagonist from the popular 16th century novel Journey To The West is described as a rakshasi. Another example is the Lokapālas, who take the form of the Four Heavenly Kings (Chinese: 四大天王; Pinyin: Sìdà Tiānwáng) in China, Taiwan and other Chinese communities. Various bodhisattvas are also described as manifesting in the form of Hindu deities. For example, Mǎtóu Guānyīn (馬頭觀音) is a manifestation of the Bodhisattva Guanyin who takes the form of the horse-headed god Hayagriva. The another manifestation of Guanyin, Zhǔntí Guānyīn (準提觀音), known in English as Cundi, is also considered to be an adaptation of the goddess Chandi, an alternate form of the goddess Parvarti. In another example, the deva or bodhisattva Mólìzhītiān (摩利支天), known in English as Mārīcī, is also identified with Cundi and with Mahēśvarī, the consort of Maheśvara, and therefore also has the title Mātrikā (佛母 Fo mǔ), Mother of the Myriad Buddhas. Many legends and stories in Chinese folk religion, such as Nezha, have been traced to Hindu mythology, such as through the 10th century translations of Tianxizai. Hanuman is also believed by some scholars to be a source for the Chinese mythological character Sun Wukong.\n\nParagraph 4: Campeggio found himself in a difficult position, since Emperor Charles V, Catherine of Aragon's nephew, was determined to prevent the divorce, and was putting pressure on Clement. The deciding point in law for Campeggio was Julius's dispensation for Henry and Catherine's marriage. In Catherine's possession from early in 1528, she showed it to Campeggio in October, and he took it to invalidate his commission, since the latter failed to cover the document. He tried to make the case disappear on 23 July 1529 by proroguing it until October, but this was forestalled by the Pope sending the matter to Rome a week earlier. On his way back to Rome, Campeggio met Charles and Clement in Bologna, where the pope gave Campeggio the castle of Dozza and the Emperor took Campeggio's family under his patronage. Charles later (2 September 1530) gave Campeggio the Spanish bishopric of Huesca and Jaca, which he held until 17 June 1534 when he became bishop of Candia (Crete) (until 1536); in 1532, moreover, when making Campeggio's son Gianbattista bishop of Majorca, the emperor reserved the administration of the see to the young man's father. Campeggio was legate to the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where he pursued negotiations with Philip Melanchthon.\n\nParagraph 5: Fleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style\". Thought style throughout Fleck's work is closely associated with representational style. A \"fact\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. He argued, however, that within the active cultural style of a thought collective, knowledge claims or facts were constrained by passive elements arising from the observations and experience of the natural world. This passive resistance of natural experience represented within the stylized means of the thought collective could be verified by anyone adhering to the culture of the thought collective, and thus facts could be agreed upon within any particular thought style. Thus while a fact may be verifiable within its own collective, it may be unverifiable in others. He felt that the development of scientific facts and concepts was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but at times required changing older concepts, methods of observations, and forms of representation. This changing of prior knowledge is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. He also notes some features of the culture of modern natural sciences that recognize provisionality and evolution of knowledge along the value of pursuit of passive resistances. This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.\n\nParagraph 6: In 2007, Cole published her first book, The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror. The book builds on the study of the rhetoric of victimization in American politics, in which the notion of victim is viewed as a useful device for the political establishment to translate failures of the system into individual faults with some group of people. Early writers on this topic include the psychologist William Ryan. Cole studies competing claims to victimhood in contemporary American politics, particularly claims on either side of the culture wars that began in the 1980s and 1990s regarding welfare, feminism, racism, and eventually the War on Terror that followed the September 11 attacks. The notion of victimhood maps naturally onto social groups because a particular set of people is claimed to be disadvantaged by the system, and it is politically salient because claims of victimhood often seek state remedies. Disagreements about victimhood can therefore cause inter-group conflicts through processes like identity politics. Cole argues that part of the source of this tension in the United States is the conflict between the idea of victimhood and the dominant American political culture: because liberal individualism is a fundamental virtue in American political identity, the notion of claiming to be a victim can be cast as pathetic and undeserving. Cole focuses on how \"anti-victimist\" figures like Charles Sykes, Robert Hughes, Shelby Steele, Alan Dershowitz and Dinesh D'Souza have used anti-victimhood rhetoric to undermine the credibility of those claiming to be victims of an unjust political system, which in turn positions those figures as victims of other peoples' professed victimhood. Conversely, Cole also studies the rejection of victimhood by some second-wave feminists, studying how authors like Naomi Wolf and Camille Paglia rejected the political tactic of identifying with victimhood as a means to accrue power by appearing powerless. Cole's study of victimhood has implications for understanding the right and left in American politics from the 1960s onwards, but primarily focuses on political disputes regarding multiculturalism, identity politics, and feminism during the 1990s, as well as how America was rhetorically cast as a victim to justify the country's response to the September 11 attacks. She also studies the implications of these rhetorical tools to policies including civil and criminal justice reform and the extent of the welfare state. In addition to The cult of true victimhood, Cole has also written about the political use of victimhood and vulnerability in peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nParagraph 7: Since its formation in 1949, Ceylon's armed forces were an internal security force assisting the Ceylon Police during strikes and riots. After the attempted coup in 1962, the armed forces had major cuts in funding, recruitment and joint operations, and were unprepared for a large-scale insurrection. In 1970, the armed forces had an annual budget of Rs 52 million (US$10mn), just 1.2% of total government expenditure. The Ceylon Army had an authorized strength of 329 officers and 6,291 other ranks with three infantry regiments each consisting of two battalions (one regular and one volunteer) armed mostly with World War II-era weapons such as Lee–Enfield .303 rifles, Sten sub machine guns, Bren light machine guns and Vickers machine guns, with a few SLR rifles; a recce regiment equipped with Ferret and Daimler Armoured Cars; an artillery regiment armed with light mortars and anti-aircraft guns. It lacked tanks, field artillery, automatic rifles, submachine guns and other modern weapons, and peacetime ammunition stocks could sustain only one week of combat operations. The Royal Ceylon Navy, which had suffered the most from the fallout of the attempted coup (its recruitment had been frozen until 1969) had only one frigate, HMCyS Gajabahu in its fleet along with a few Thorneycroft coastal motor boats. The Royal Ceylon Air Force which had three flying squadrons and a few trained pilots in 1971, No. 1 Flying Training Squadron consisted of nine de Havilland Chipmunk trainers tasked with basic pilot training; the No. 2 Transport Squadron had three de Havilland Dove, four de Havilland Heron and three Scottish Aviation Pioneers fixed wing aircraft and three Bell 206 JetRanger helicopters; and the No. 3 Reconnaissance Squadron had two de Havilland Doves tasked with maritime patrol. It had mothballed its five Hunting Jet Provost T51s jet trainers after plans for introducing jet fighters were scrapped.\n\nParagraph 8: The football team has won the Central Jersey Group IV titles in 1974, 1981 and 2002, and won the North II Group IV state sectional championships in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2011, the Central Group V title in 2016 and the North II Group V in 2018. The 1974 team won in one of the first seven games of the playoff era, defeating Colonia High School by a score of 14-7 in the championship game played indoors at Atlantic City Conventional Hall. In 1981, the team won the Central Jersey Group IV title with a 20-0 win against Middletown High School South in the finals. The 2002 team won the Central Jersey Group IV sectional title with a 14-7 win against Hunterdon Central Regional High School, earning consideration from the Courier News as one of \"the best in GMC history\". In 2004, the team finished with a 12-0 record after winning the North II Group IV title against Phillipsburg High School in overtime by a score of 27-26. In 2008, the team finished the season at 11-1 after winning the North II Group IV state sectional title by a score of 38-0 in the championship game against Hunterdon Central Regional High School, after losing to them in the finals in 2007. Piscataway football won the 2010 North II Group IV state sectional title by a score of 34–6 over Hunterdon Central; The Chiefs finished the season undefeated at 12-0, marking the third time the team has gone undefeated in school history, and set a program record with 412 points scored that season. In 2011, Piscataway beat Elizabeth High School 41–34 with 17 seconds left to earn the North II Group IV title for the Chiefs. 2011 marked the 15th consecutive year that Piscataway had made the playoffs. In 2016, the team won the Central Jersey Group V title with a 34–13 win against Manalapan High School in the tournament final. In 2018, the team won the North II Group V state sectional championship with a 28-7 win against Union City High School and went on to finish the season with a 13-0 record with a 31-21 win against Ridgewood High School in the North Group V bowl game.\n\nParagraph 9: Route assignment, route choice, or traffic assignment concerns the selection of routes (alternative called paths) between origins and destinations in transportation networks.  It is the fourth step in the conventional transportation forecasting model, following trip generation, trip distribution, and mode choice. The zonal interchange analysis of trip distribution provides origin-destination trip tables.  Mode choice analysis tells which travelers will use which mode.  To determine facility needs and costs and benefits, we need to know the number of travelers on each route and link of the network (a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination). We need to undertake traffic (or trip) assignment.  Suppose there is a network of highways and transit systems and a proposed addition.  We first want to know the present pattern of traffic delay and then what would happen if the addition were made.\n\nParagraph 10: The move away from timar farming, and to privatized revenue collection, took place against the backdrop of massive upheaval in the 17th and early 18th century Ottoman Empire. Previously, the timar system had been supported by Ottoman military advances and newly conquered territories, opening up newly conquered territories to be assigned, as well as provided spoils of war to pay the troops, which encouraged continual campaigning. However, the slowing and eventual end of Ottoman territorial expansion put this era of easy land to an end. Around the same time, warfare and the Ottoman army faced drastic changes. Salaried infantry equipped with  firearms replaced sipahi cavalrymen, and their tax levies. In 1695, malikane mukata’a, or life-term tax farms, were introduced, granting buyers the right to revenues on the parcel until the death of the holder, and freeing them from local oversight in exchange for incentivizing long-term growth. As the shift to mukata’a began to gain traction, a new class in Ottoman society began to emerge. With the privatization of annual revenue collection, wealthy officials, or those with the access to information that could make them wealthy in the new investing market for mukata’a, had the ability to turn corners of the Empire into their own private fiefdoms, exerting control through a network of agents. However, Ariel Salzmann identifies this phenomenon not as a loss of control for the center, but instead “rationalized state control in a politically effective form.” Malikane mukata’a contracts, thus, became a way to extend the definition of the center, allowing the wealthy across the empire to become part of the center, and “curb the power of local officials who often usurped the state’s prerogatives over taxation”. With the inclusion of elite from every corner of the empire, financed by Jewish, Greek and Armenian bankers, a new Ottoman ruling class emerged, open to any with the wealth or savvy to buy into the system."}

The wrestlers for the Infierno en el Ring match entered the ring, with the tecnicos (good guys) coming out first, followed by the rudos (bad guys). Before the match, it was announced that there would be a three-minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the match began, all 12 wrestlers started fighting. Hooligan was the first to escape the cage after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X. Ángel de Oro and Ángel de Plata both attempted to climb the cage simultaneously, but Ángel de Plata pulled his brother off so he could escape alone. Monster and Sensei were the next to escape, followed by Tiger Kid preventing his brother Puma King from escaping so he could get out himself. Ángel Azteca Jr. also climbed out of the cage to secure his mask. Puma King and Ángel de Oro initially worked together to escape, but Puma King betrayed Ángel de Oro and escaped alone. With Diamante's escape, only four wrestlers remained in the ring. Histeria abandoned Doctor X to escape the cage, and Ángel de Oro accidentally hit Fabián el Gitano, allowing Doctor X to escape the cage instead of punishing his rival further.", "Sir Robert was a highly decorated and accomplished military officer. He participated in numerous battles and campaigns, including the Battle of Ballinamuck, battles in Cape, and South America. He was present at significant events such as the Battle of Corunna, the passage of the Douro, the Battle of Busaco, the lines of Torres Vedras, and the siege and reduction of Olivenza. He played a role in the sieges and stormings of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, and fought in notable battles like the Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse. Sir Robert received multiple honors and awards, including the gold cross and various clasps for his valour in battles. The Portuguese government recognized him with the Knight of the Tower and Sword, and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with the organizers of the Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.\n\nParagraph 2: Originally played on a no-line court, each match consists of five sets. Each set features a different configuration (men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles). Prior to each match, coaches decide the order in which the sets will be played. Each player on a team usually plays in at least one of the five sets. Scoring is no-advantage; there is no requirement to win a game by two points; at deuce, whoever scores the next point wins the game. The first team to reach five games wins each set. A nine-point tiebreaker is played if a set reaches four-all. One point is awarded for each game won. If necessary, extended play and a supertiebreaker are played to determine the winner of the match.\n\nParagraph 3: Diamond color is graded by comparing a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone is known to exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where in the range of color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards ( i.e.  \"upside down\"— resting on the face one normally looks at). When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.\n\nParagraph 4: Besides the Battle of Ballinamuck, two at the Cape, and three in South America, Sir Robert was present at the Battle of Corunna, the passage of the Douro, the battle of Busaco, the lines of Torres Vedras, the siege and reduction of Olivenza, the first siege of Badajoz, the battle of Albuera, the siege and storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, the third siege and storming of Badajoz, the battles of the Nivelle, Nive, passage of the Adour, and the battles of Orthes and Toulouse. He received the gold cross and three clasps for Busaco, Albuera, Badajoz, Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the war medal and two clasps for Corunna and Ciudad Rodrigo. He also received Portuguese and Spanish orders, including the special star given by the Portuguese government to all English officers of superior rank engaged at Albuera. He brought home the despatches regarding Albuera, and on that occasion was appointed a brevet lieutenant-colonel. He was created a knight of the Tower and Sword by the government of Portugal, and in 1815 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1830, he attained the rank of major-general, and in 1838 was appointed to the command of the troops in Ceylon, after which he commanded a division in Bengal until his promotion as lieutenant-general in 1841. In 1843, he was appointed colonel of the 76th Foot.\n\nParagraph 5: The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (GOCC, Polish Wielka Orkiestra Świątecznej Pomocy, WOŚP) is the biggest, non-governmental, non-profit, charity organization in Poland raising money for pediatric and elderly care. The GOCC Foundation holds American Heart Association certification to provide courses in CPR and AED, and for the use of high technology for medical lifesaving. The GOCC aims to support health care in Poland by purchase of state of the art medical equipment for Polish hospitals and clinics and by establishing and running six medical programmes and one educational programme. The foundation supports pediatric and geriatric wards, furnishing them in both complex medical devices such as MRI scanners, and providing long-term care units with anti-bedsore mattresses and beds.\n\nParagraph 6: Safina enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2008. She compiled a disappointing singles win–loss record of 11–10 to start the season but won her third consecutive doubles title at the Brisbane International with Ágnes Szávay and her first and only Tier I doubles title at the Pacific Life Open with compatriot, Elena Vesnina, during the same period. Safina began her singles recovery by claiming her first Tier I singles title at the Qatar Telecom German Open, defeating World No. 1 Justine Henin, fifth seed Serena Williams, future World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka and seventh seed Elena Dementieva in the final. She later commented that the tournament had been \"the key to her tennis life\" as she had \"felt completely lost before that tournament\". At the French Open, Safina defeated World No. 1 Maria Sharapova and seventh seed Elena Dementieva in consecutive rounds after rallying from a set, 5–2 and a match point down in both matches; before overcoming fourth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets to reach the first Grand Slam singles final of her career, where she lost in straight sets to the second seed, Ana Ivanovic. After a less impressive grass court season, during which she reached her second (and last) career singles final on grass at the Ordina Open, Safina embarked on a fifteen match winning streak, winning singles titles in Los Angeles and Montréal respectively before securing herself the silver medal in women's singles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, after a three set loss to Dementieva in the final. As a result of her strong performances in the lead-up to the US Open, Safina finished on top of the 2008 US Open Series leader board. At the final Grand Slam event of the year, Safina advanced to her first US Open semifinal and second major singles semifinal overall after a straight sets victory over 16th seed, Flavia Pennetta. Following the event, Safina entered the top five of the WTA singles rankings for the first time, rising to world No. 5. A week later, she captured her third Tier I singles title and fourth singles title of the season overall at the Pan Pacific Open, dropping just four games in the final against Kuznetsova. As a result, she entered the top three of the WTA singles rankings for the first time in her career, rising to world No. 3. In November, Safina made her debut at the year-ending WTA Championships but lost in the round robin stage. Nevertheless, she ended the year ranked World No. 3, marking her first finish in the year-end top five and top ten.\n\nParagraph 7: Roxxon is revealed to be orchestrating the young superheroes being falsely outlawed by the public. Having acquired the dragons from War of the Realms event, their first step was to get rid of the high schooler Aliana Kabua. Although Kamala Khan got injured from saving Aliana, Roxxon begin to shift the blame to the Champions for the damage they never started. While forming a partnership with Senator Geoffrey Patrick and C.R.A.D.L.E., Roxxon manipulates them into unknowingly furthering their shady businesses, such as permanent imprisonment, brainwashing and unethical experimentation, as well as possibly kidnapping of the kids who oppose the unjust law. Viv Vision, who survived Roxxon's assault on Aliana, had been monitoring her fellow younger superheroes, but discovers that she is unintentionally selling her friends to C.R.A.D.L.E. and Roxxon. Once the Champions reveals Roxxon's conspiracy to Senator Patrick and the public, the senator finally begins to repeal the unjust law, ending the partnership with Roxxon, and clearing Kamala's name while re-evaluating his business dealings. Later, Miles Morales and Sam Alexander go undercover as interns, prior to being suggested to hire Kamala Kahn. While Roxxon attempts to cover up their illegal activity by releasing a social app called \"Roxx-On\", a Champion and a former prisoner of C.R.A.D.L.E.'s harassment, Snowguard rallies a group of mobs because they still openly do not trust Roxxon for their previous activities. Much worst, Roxxon already hired Ironheart's nemesis from Stark Unlimited, Andre Sims, in an attempt to collect data to dispose of those who are deemed threats to its business. He replaced young superheroes with his Chaperon robots to ensure the unjust Kamala's Law remains active. During Roxx-On concert, Roxxon lost its public trust thanks to Kamala's public speech about the company's ongoing shady business, thus repealing Kamala's Law and disbanding C.R.A.D.L.E.. However, Roxxon's reputation becomes worst when Andre attempts to dispose of young people like the Champions because of his personal issues, but is immediately stopped by Roxxon's higher-up Miriam Blakemoore. After that, Roxxon finally makes a public speech to apologize for their actions and takes responsibility for Andre's crime.\n\nParagraph 8: The character has received positive critical and public reception. Upon her debut in Tekken 3, Next Generation commented that she and fellow Tekken 3 character Julia Chang \"conform to different and equally depressing 'cute schoolgirl' stereotypes\", while PlayStation Universe felt she was unique in the franchise due to her innocence rarely seen in other characters. Robert Workman of GameDaily named Ling Xiaoyu as one of his favorite female Asian video game characters, calling her \"a joy to behold\". GameDaily rated her among the \"chicks that will kick your ass\": \"If you mistake Ling Xiaoyu for an innocent schoolgirl, prepare to get your nose schooled.\" In yet another article by GameDaily, they complimented her as \"hot,\" and that she \"knows how to dress\". Writing for ImpulseGamer, model Tara Babcock called Xiaoyu her favorite Tekken character due to her moves and most notably her hairstyle. MSN said of the character made the cheongsam fashionable again, and reminded the world that girls in tight clothing can still pull off some amazing fighting moves. Kevin Wong of Complex rated her the eleventh-best Tekken character in 2013: \"Ling Xiaoyu is what happens when you put an 8-year-old girl's mind into a 19-year-old girl's body. With her plaid-skirted school uniform, barely legal hairstyle, and butt slapping shenanigans, Ling is somehow both kawaii and creepy.\" IGN called Xiaoyu \"a fun character to use\", while \"everyone loves a schoolgirl that can kick some booty.\" FHM listed Xiaoyu and Chun-Li as one of the \"10 awesome fantasy fights\" in Street Fighter X Tekken. Anthony Taormina of Game Rant called Xiaoyu \"not just a representative of the strong female fighters in Tekken, but in video games in general\", but in describing what he considered the unrealistic depiction of students in video games (\"A peppy individual who enjoys nothing more than dabbling in deadly martial arts during their free periods\"), David Meikleham of GamesRadar commented on Xiaoyu: \"Instead, she’d be spending all her downtime writing essays, revising and generally making her brow as furrowed as possible.\" Stakester praised the handling and impact Xiaoyu has in the fighting game genre as a result of her charming personality and dream.\n\nParagraph 9: Arthur Pue Gorman (March 11, 1839June 4, 1906) was an American politician. He was leader of the Gorman-Rasin organization with Isaac Freeman Rasin that controlled the Maryland Democratic Party from the late 1870s until his death in 1906. Gorman served as United States Senator from Maryland from 1881 to 1899 and again from 1903 until his death. He was a prominent leader of the Bourbon Democrat faction of the Democratic Party. Gorman was Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during Grover Cleveland's 1884 Presidential campaign and he is widely credited with securing Cleveland's victory. In 1952 Gorman was described in The Baltimore Sun as \"easily the most powerful political figure [Maryland] has ever known.\"\n\nParagraph 10: The CMLL crew took less than 15 minutes to set up the steel cage for the main event, which was fast for the type of cage that CMLL uses. After the cage was assembled the participants for the Infierno en el Ring match came to the ring, tecnicos first (Ángel de Oro, Ángel de Plata, Ángel Azteca Jr., Diamante, Fabián el Gitano and Sensei) followed by the rudos (Doctor X, Hooligan, Puma King, Tiger Kid, Monster and Histeria). Before the match it was announced that there would be a three-minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the bell rings all 12 wrestlers began fighting, some pairing up against the wrestlers they had been feuding with for a while, Dr. X and Fabián el Gitano, Los Ángeles and Puma King and Tiger Kid. The theme of the match was \"every man for himself\", demonstrated by Hooligan as he was the first man to escape after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X in order to escape the cage. Ángel de Oro and Ángel de Plata both climbed the cage at the same time, only to have Ángel de Plata pull his brother off the cage so he could escape himself. While the other wrestlers were preoccupied Monster saw an opening and climbed out of the cage, the third man to escape the match. Moments later Sensei becomes the fourth man to escape the cage, keeping his mask safe. The brother team of Puma King and Tiger Kid are the next to try to escape the cage, but like with the Ángel brothers Tiger Kid prevented his brother from escaping so that he could get out of the cage himself. Out next was Ángel Azteca Jr. who climbed over the cage to ensure he would not have to fight for his mask that night. Puma King and Ángel de Oro seemed to work together to escape the cage, only for Puma King to double cross Ángel de Oro so that Puma King could escape the cage. With Diamante's escape there are only four wrestlers left in the ring. Histeria quickly abandons fellow rudo Doctor X to escape the cage, saving his match for the second time in a week. In the cage Ángel de Oro accidentally hit Fabián el Gitano when he was trying to hit Doctor X. This gave the Doctor an opening to escape the cage, choosing to leave the cage instead of trying to punish his rival Fabián el Gitano further."}

However, the attack on Vit Thu Lu was canceled due to heavy clouds. The strike on Đồng Hới was carried out by 29 A-4 Skyhawks from attack squadrons VA-153 and VA-155, hitting the barracks with rockets and bombs. North Vietnamese antiaircraft gunners put up a strong defense, firing from both ashore and Swatow gunboats in the Kien River. Lieutenant Edward A.

On November 30th, Davis and his squadron encountered a group of Chinese bombers and fighters en route to a bombing mission. Despite being attacked by the enemy fighters, Davis successfully destroyed two bombers and caused the crew of a third to eject. When another group of F-86s arrived, Davis's aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. He flew to the aid of a fellow pilot who was under attack from 24 MiG-15s. Davis managed to shoot down one of the MiGs and escorted the damaged aircraft back to base. For his actions, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Additionally, the successful bombing mission on Taehwado Island led to the end of all Chinese bombing missions for the rest of the war.

Around 16:00, Davis' flight of eight F-86s spotted a large group of nine Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Chinese 8th Bomber Division, escorted by 16 Lavochkin La-11 fighters from the Chinese 2nd Fighter Division near Sahol along the Yalu River. The force was en route to a bombing mission on Taehwado Island in the Pansong archipelago. Davis maneuvered the patrol into position for a firing pass on the bombers. He completed four attack runs on the formation, being continuously attacked by the La-11 fighters, which were unable to hit his aircraft. In spite of being separated from his wingmen, he managed to destroy two of the bombers and cause the crew of a third to bail out. By this time, another group of F-86s arrived to continue the fight, as Davis' aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. As the flight attempted to withdraw, one of Davis' pilots, Raymond O. Barton, called for help. Davis flew to Barton's aid and found Barton's damaged aircraft under attack from 24 MiG-15s of the Chinese 3rd Fighter Division arriving as reinforcement. As two MiG-15s prepared a final attack on Barton, Davis swooped through their pass and scored direct hits on one, killing the Chinese flight leader who commanded the MiG pack. The second broke off its attack. Davis then escorted Barton's damaged aircraft back to base, landing with only  of fuel left in his tanks. For the day's actions, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Taehwado bombing mission forced the Chinese Air Force to end all bombing missions for the rest of the war, while the \"hat trick\"-plus-one of downing four Chinese aircraft in the fight resulted in raising Davis' confirmed victory count in Korea to six, making him the fifth jet ace of the war and the first man in the history of the US military to become an ace in two wars. At this point, Davis wrote to his family that he expected to be home by Christmas, but then the Air Force extended his tour of duty.\n\nParagraph 2: \"Violently Happy\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. It was defined \"bittersweet\" by Heather Phares of AllMusic, and \"insanely addictive\" by Sean McCarthy of The Daily Vault, which also deemed its title as \"one of the best song titles of all time\". The Daily Telegraph'''s journalist Emily Bearn noticed that \"Violently Happy\" finds her making guttural noises at the sea: \"I tip-toe down to the shore/Stand by the ocean/Make it roar at me/And I roar back\". Brantley Bardin of Details commented that \"songs like “Violently Happy” summed up a worldview that put all its faith in emotional abandon instead of logic. “Too much cleverness,” says Björk, “is the worst disease in the world. It ruins everything. Give us a laugh—make us happy\". Brad Beatnik from Music Weeks RM Dance Update wrote, \"A typical fourth single, this might not be quite as immediate as her previous hits but it still has some damn fine moments.\" In particular, Simon Reynolds of The New York Times praised the song generally, \"The title of 'Violently Happy' captures the Björk effect perfectly: a gush and rush of euphoria, a tidal wave of oceanic feeling. Over the song's brisk house beats, Björk stammers as she struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin: 'I'm driving my car too fast with ecstatic music on/I'm daring people to jump off roofs with me.' In the end, she and Mr. Hooper resort to studio wizardry to gesture at inexpressible feelings, sampling one syllable and turning it into a stuttering vocal tic\". Johnny Dee from NME commented, \"More fun, madness and surprise follows\", noting its \"pulsating grind\". Sylvia Patterson from Smash Hits gave it four out of five, writing, \"Not quite the jovial rejoicings of \"Big Time Sensuality\" but a giant of space-dance majesty, nonetheless.\" Troy J.

David Petrilla from The Weekender stated that the singer \"is aiming directly at the dance floor\" with the song.\n\nParagraph 3: U.S. Navy aircraft carriers launched aircraft for strikes on the barracks at Vit Thu Lu and Đồng Hới, both just north of the DMZ. The attack on Vit Thu Lu was cancelled because of heavy clouds over the target. The weather was little better at Dong Hoi, home of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 325th Infantry Division. A 29-plane strike formation from  approached the target under a low cloud ceiling at 500 knots. The A-4 Skyhawks of attack squadrons VA-153 and VA-155 hit the barracks with rockets and 250-pound bombs. Prepared as they had not been during Operation Pierce Arrow, North Vietnamese antiaircraft gunners threw up a curtain of fire from 37-millimeter guns, automatic weapons and small arms ashore and from Swatow gunboats in the Kien River. Some of this fire hit Lieutenant Edward A. Dickson's A-4 but he continued his attack before ejecting from his crippled plane, however his parachute failed to open and he plunged to his death. Right behind Coral Seas formation came 17 A-4s of VA-212 and VA-216 from the  which dropped their ordnance on already burning and smoking camp facilities as F-8 Crusaders suppressed fire from antiaircraft sites. Completing the mission, RF-8A reconnaissance aircraft rolled in to photograph the scene for naval intelligence analysis. The results were unimpressive. The attack had destroyed or damaged only 22 of the 275 buildings in the camp.\n\nParagraph 4: Despite his hot-headed tendencies, Sharon sees a different side to Grant, and when he proposes marriage to her, she accepts on the condition that he buys her childhood home, The Queen Vic, which he does. Grant marries Sharon in December 1991 and together they run The Queen Vic. Their marriage is stormy and punctuated with violent rows and fights. Grant is desperate for a child, although Sharon would rather concentrate on the pub for the time being, and when he discovers Sharon is still taking contraception, he smashes up the pub and then disappears. In his absence, Sharon is comforted by Phil and they begin an affair, although this comes to an abrupt end when Grant returns and promises to change his ways. He cannot live up to his promises, however, and, on Sharon's birthday in October 1992, Grant sets fire to The Queen Vic to generate insurance money to pay off debts. He does not check to see whether Sharon is out of the way, and she and her dog Roly nearly die in the blaze. The insurance money is insufficient, and Sharon reacts with fury when she discovers what Grant has done. She leaves Grant for a while, and, when she returns and attempts to seize control of The Queen Vic, Grant turns violent, assaults Sharon and her best friend, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), and is imprisoned on remand. While he is in prison, Sharon and Phil rekindle their affair, but neither can confess to Grant, and it ends when he is released from prison. Sharon and Grant patch up their relationship; however, in the autumn of 1994, Grant discovers a tape on which Sharon talks about her affair with Phil, and plays it to a packed pub at Phil's engagement party to his fiancée, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). In response, Grant batters Phil – leaving him with a ruptured spleen – and is abusive towards Sharon until she flees to the United States, signalling the end of their marriage after just three years. She returns briefly to enact revenge – making Grant realise that he is still in love with her, he chooses to be with Sharon over his family. Sharon is ready to turn him down in front of a packed pub and his family; however, in the end, she cannot go through with it, and stops him from publicly proposing before he humiliates himself. She then confesses to him that she no longer loves him, before returning to the US, leaving Grant heartbroken. They are then divorced and do not see each other for more than 10 years after this. Michelle has a volatile relationship with Grant but, following Sharon's exit, falls pregnant following a one-night stand with him and then flees to the US without telling Grant that he is to be a father. Grant would not find out that the baby is his until years later.\n\nParagraph 5: The Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department was started in 1947 after the tragic deaths of three children in a house fire. It was officially established in 1948, and its first piece of equipment was a 1927 American LaFrance pumper. The station was built in 1950, with expansions in 1963 and 1993. In 1991, Ashburn Volunteer Fire Department expanded its services and added its first ambulance. In 1996, it officially became the Ashburn Volunteer Fire-Rescue Department.  In 2010 Station 22, Landsdowne, was opened. AVF&R is supplemented by career staffing 7 days a week from 0600-1800. Station 22 also houses Safety Officer 600, since BC 601 moved to Station 24/35 in January 2014, and Station 6 houses a 24/7 career medic unit. AVFRD currently has plans and blueprints to renovate the original station 6 building. The plan currently calls for the existing station to be torn down, leaving the banquet hall \"Founder's Hall\" standing, and creating a new building on the old ground. Additionally, the company has plans to completely upgrade its fleet with a potential new color scheme. The process of upgrading the fleet began in early 2014, with the order of two brand new Ferrara fire engines, which will potentially highlight the possible new company color-scheme of black and yellow. Additionally, plans are in place for the order of two new ambulances, and the replacement of T606 with a Tiller truck. In late January 2014 it was announced that Engine 606C, the old Wagon, would be decommissioned and was removed from service at the beginning of February. On March 3, 2014 it was announced that the Chaplain chase vehicle had been sold to a member of the company, would have its emergency equipment removed and the unit would be taken out of service. In early 2014, Safety 600, which had recently been replaced by a new SUV of apparatus similar to the BC vehicles, was replaced with a pick-up truck with a covered bed, though still using the new color scheme. In May 2014, construction of temporary facilities on Station 6 property began, with expected demolition of the current facility and then groundbreaking for the new building to happen in June. The new station became operational in March 2016. In Summer, 2017 AVFRD took delivery of a brand new Tiller, to replace the company's Truck unit. The unit is currently going through outfitting to go in-service. Additionally, in 2017, AVFRD replaced all five ambulances, and put in service an ATV unit, to be used on the W&OD trail and for public events. AVFRD is currently in the process of designing a heavy rescue vehicle, a first for Ashburn, and a replacement tower-ladder unit. In May, 2018 it was confirmed that the Shift Commander would begin running out of Station 22 over the summer. At the end of June 2018, OP600 started running out of station 22. On Wednesday 6/27/18, TT606 went in service operationally, and ran its first calls. In July, 2018 an internal memo was released stating that the Safety Officer 600 designation would be changed to instead reflect the Battalion that the unit operated in. Because of this SO600 was renamed to SO601; this may be in anticipation of additional Safety Officer's being added to operations.\n\nParagraph 6: While the mounted troops pursued the beaten enemy, 74th (Y) Division paused and re-equipped with winter clothing for the next phase of the campaign. By 25 November the division was about four days' march behind the fighting line, but it was brought up for the advance into the Judaean Hills towards Jerusalem. The Turks launched strong counter-attacks on 27 and 28 November, and 74th (Y) Division began arriving to reinforce the position on 29 November, 231st Bde having marched 12 out of the previous 18 hours. Coming under 52nd (L) Division the brigade took over scattered positions from the remnants of 8th Mounted Brigade, 24th RWF filling the gap across to the neighbouring 60th (2/2nd London) Division, so it took little part in the confused fighting on 29/30 November.  Although. 25th RWF temporarily captured the hilltop village of Foqa and 24th Welsh briefly recaptured Et Tire next morning, the positions were untenable and they were compelled to fall back to the high ground and begin building a defensive line of stone sangars. 231st and 229th Bdes had difficulty forming a solid defensive front in the confused country. However, on 8 December the EEF launched its final attack on Jerusalem. 74th (Y) Division's surprise attack on a narrow front was supported by flanking fire from 231st Bde in the Nebi Samwil defences (confused by the fact that there were also Turkish machine guns concealed in the ruined village). Next day Jerusalem surrendered and the division was then engaged in road-making for most of the month while the EEF defended Jerusalem against Turkish counter-attacks. 74th (Y) Division resumed its advance on the morning of 27 December, led by 229th Bde. 24th RWF then took up the attack at 10.15, having concentrated in the Wadi Salman in front of Beit Duqqu during the night. One company captured Kh. Dreihemeh while two others attacked Hill 2450 and succeeded in reaching the crest. However, nether group could get beyond the summits, and each was enfiladed by fire from the enemy on the reverse slope of the other feature. The companies on Hill 2450 were attacked again and again, and forced slightly down the hill. During the afternoon a second assault was delivered after an artillery bombardment, but the Turkish machine guns on Kh. Dreihemeh swept the crest of Hill 2450 and the attempt failed. The positions were held until 22.00 when 24th RWF, having suffered heavy casualties, was relieved by 24th Welsh. Next morning 229th and 231st Bdes worked their way forwards on the other hills, splitting the enemy fire; 231st Bde was withdrawn into reserve by the end of 8 December. By 31 December the EEF had established a strong defence line covering Jerusalem. The division then went into reserve and resumed roadbuilding.\n\nParagraph 7: The episode garnered a largely positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly wrote that the episode \"Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation\" before concluding that the episode was \"fairly standard.\" The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, \"I used to be a huge \"Scooby Doo\" fan. [...] Of course, none of [the villains] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales.\" Handlen ultimately called the episode \"Essential.\" Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that \"The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening.\" Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode \"an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space.\" He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was \"both scary and wondrous\" and \"offer[ed] no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility.\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not \"what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best.\"\n\nParagraph 8: Some shells (e.g. bash) provide a shell builtin that may be used to prevent SIGHUP being sent or propagated to existing jobs, even if they were not started with nohup. In bash, this can be obtained by using disown -h job; using the same builtin without arguments removes the job from the job table, which also implies that the job will not receive the signal. Before using disown on an active job, it should be stopped by Ctrl-Z, and continued in the background by the bg command. Another relevant bash option is shopt huponexit, which automatically sends the HUP signal to jobs when the shell is exiting normally.\n\nParagraph 9: In the opening scene of Blade, in 1967, a pregnant Vanessa Brooks is attacked by a vampire, causing her to go into premature labor. Doctors are able to save her baby, who she names Eric, but the woman dies of an unknown cause. Thirty years later, Eric, now named Blade, has become a vampire hunter, possessing an eidetic memory, he remembers every moment of his life, including being born. After Blade raids a Los Angeles rave club owned by the vampire Deacon Frost, police take one of the vampires he had burned to the hospital, where-to he follows to continue killing them after they awake, kill Dr. Curtis Webb and feeds on hematologist, Karen Jenson, to regain his strength, and escape from Blade. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend, mentor, and surrogate father, Abraham Whistler, who explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight, silver, and garlic. As Karen is now \"marked\" by the bite of a vampire to become one-herself, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city. After Karen returns to her apartment and is attacked by police officers. Blade subdues Krieger, a \"familiar\" (a human loyal to vampires), and uses information from him to locate an archive that contains pages from \"The Book of Erebus\" (the Vampire Nation's Bible). He comes upon Pearl, a morbidly obese vampire, and tortures him with a UV light into revealing that Deacon wants to command a ritual where he would use 12 pure-blood vampires to awaken the \"blood god\" La Magra; to which Blade's blood is the key: Blade reveals to Karen that he is a dhampir, a human-vampire hybrid possessing the supernatural abilities of the vampires without any of their weaknesses; except for the requirement to consume human blood and the ability to age normally; while Blade injects himself with a special serum that suppresses his urge to drink blood, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse. Deciding to help Blade, Karen experiments with the anticoagulant EDTA as a possible replacement, finding that it explodes when combined with vampire blood and giving it to Blade to use as a weapon, while also synthesizing a vaccine that can cure the infected like her, but which will not work on Blade. Karen tells Blade that she is confident that she can cure his bloodthirst with years of treating it. However, while Blade is hunting Frost's forces, Frost and his men attack his hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he reluctantly helps Whistler commit suicide.\n\nParagraph 10: The exact origin of Kalighat painting is a matter of debate and speculation among art critics and historians, for there exists no historical account which records a specific date, or traces the beginnings of this school which was established by the patuas at Kalighat. Material evidence such as the type of paper, and colours used in the paintings, suggest that they belong to the first half of the 19th century. Furthermore, noting the dates of acquisition of these paintings by various European collectors, historians have concluded that the emergence of the paintings roughly coincides with the establishment of the present-day Kali temple at Kalighat, in approximately the first or second quarter of the 19th century. The Victoria and Albert Museum website mentions, for instance, that the artworks in the museum have been \"created and collected over a period of 100 years from 1830s to the 1930s\". However, S. Chakravarti estimates “Kalighat paintings were in vogue not earlier than 1850s”.Moreover, it was by the early 19th century that Calcutta evolved as an economic centre driven by the commercial activities generated by the British and other European settlers which attracted immigrants looking for employment opportunities. The Kalighat Temple, in the southern part of the city, became a popular destination which attracted hundreds of pilgrims, certain foreign visitors as well as the local people. The artisans and craftsmen, for whom the temple premises provided the perfect opportunity to sell their products, started migrating to the region with the hope of capitalising on the new growing market. Among them were the patuas, the skilled artists who hailed from rural Bengal, especially from the areas of Midnapore and the 24 Parganas. These artists would traditionally paint long narrative stories on scrolls of cloth or handmade paper, which often expanded to a length of 20 metres and beyond. Such an art form was known as patachitra, each section was called the pat which explains why the artists were known as patuas. The first mention of such a group of travelling folk painters appears in the thirteenth century text, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana. These artists depicted conventional images of deities and scenes from the two Hindu epics, carrying their scrolls while moving from one place to another, and singing the scenes and episodes portrayed in the paintings in public gatherings or during festivals in villages."}

An abbey was established in Ħal Għargħur during this time, but it is unknown when and why it was abandoned. It is speculated that constant pirate attacks on the village may have led to a decline in population. During these raids, houses were built with secret rooms for residents, particularly females, to hide in. The streets and alleys were also designed in a way to confuse invaders.

The proposal faced opposition from Icelandic activists and foreign bioethicists, who criticized the commercial nature of the database and the inclusion of medical records without individuals' consent. Despite the IHD never being built, the debate highlighted the challenges of involving society in a scientific initiative and catapulted deCODE to international prominence in the study of the human genome."], "answers": ["Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 5", "Paragraph 8"], "context": "Paragraph 1: The Eagles finished second in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division for the 2003-04 season, with a record of 31-12-4-3, losing in the Division finals to Osoyoos. They lost in the first round the following season to Revelstoke. But in 2005-06, the Eagles won the league title for a third time, defeating Beaver Valley in the final again. The Eagles have yet to win another league title. The 2006-07 Eagles suffered a considerable drop in form, finishing fourth in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division, and losing in the first round to the Kamloops Storm. The following year, the divisions of the KIJHL were re-organized, and the Eagles were moved to the Eddie Mountain Conference, East Division. They finished second in their division, but lost in the Division finals to the Revelstoke Grizzlies. In 2008-09, the league was again re-sorted, and the Eagles finished second in the new Okanagan Division. They would lose in the first round to Kamloops. The following season, they finished third in the Okanagan Division, before losing in the second round to the Princeton Posse. In 2010-11, the Eagles were sorted into the new Doug Birks Division, and finished third again, losing to Kamloops in the first round. The following season, the Eagles would finish fourth in their division, and lost in the second round to the Kelowna Chiefs. In 2012-13, the Eagles improved to second in the Doug Birks Division, losing to the North Okanagan Knights in the Division final. 2013-14 saw the Eagles drop to fourth in the Division again, losing 4-1 in the opening round to the Kamloops Storm. The next season would see an identical result, with the Eagles fourth and losing 4-1 to Kamloops, and this marked the first time in franchise history that the Eagles lost in the first round of the playoffs in two consecutive years. Another franchise low occurred in 2015-16, as the Eagles missed the playoffs for the first time in their history, compiling a 10-34-2-6 record, fifth in the Doug Birks Division.\n\nParagraph 2: There is little written information about the people of Għargħur in earlier days. One source of information is the Dejma list, which mentions Għargħur in conjunction with Ħal Samudi (Madliena). In the Middle Ages, Għargħur was most probably a very small rural community. An abbey was established in Ħal Għargħur in the Middle Ages, in an area now called Tar-Rħieb (Friars' (old Maltese) place). There is no evidence as to when and why this abbey was abandoned, but the reason could have been the constant pirate attacks on the village, which led to a severe depopulation of both Għargħur and nearby settlements. During these raids, settlements were looted and those considered valuable enough were taken into slavery. Indeed, in this period houses in Għargħur were built so as to allow the residents to lock themselves in. One feature of these houses was a secret room in which females used to hide during these attacks. Also, the old streets and alleys are planned in a way that would confuse visitors. These raids continued well into the years, even after Għargħur became a parish. Indeed, on one occasion the residents of Għargħur found refuge in the parish church and vowed that if they were unharmed, there would be an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of [Mellieħa]. Nobody was harmed or taken into slavery on that occasion, and thus the tradition of holding this pilgrimage was started.\n\nParagraph 3: The Hybridity of Childhood: This discussion is more critical (though not dismissive) of the social constructionist approaches that have dominated the sociology of childhood since the 1990s. More open to materialist perspectives, it seeks an interdisciplinary path that recognizes the biological as well as the social and cultural shaping of childhood and holds open the possibility of an interdisciplinary Childhood Studies emergent from current multi-disciplinary efforts. This scholarship has two important influences. Firstly, a so-called 'new wave' of childhood studies, heavily influenced by Alan Prout's (2005) seminal book The Future of Childhood. In this work, Prout examines how childhoods are not merely constructed socially – via discourses, laws or institutions – but materially, through toys, food and medicines. Since then, sociologists such as Nick Lee have offered important analyses of the ways in which the 'entanglements' between children and non-human materialities and technologies have become ever-more important to the governance and regulation of children's lives, through what he terms the 'biopoliticisation' of childhood. Secondly, nonrepresentational approaches to children's geographies have offered a commensurate and (arguably) broader series of approaches that move beyond social constructivism. Scholars such as Peter Kraftl, John Horton and Affrica Taylor have been particularly influential in examining how childhoods are produced and experienced through complex intersections of emotion, affect, embodiment and materiality. Somewhat problematically, there has been relatively little overlap between these two strands of scholarship, despite their sharing common conceptual foundations in the work of post-structuralism, new materialism and posthumanism. Nevertheless, during the mid-2010s, a so-called 'spatial turn' in childhood and education studies saw increasing cross-fertilisation between these fields and the take-up of children's geographers' work by sociologists and others. Therefore, the prospects for cross-disciplinary scholarship around hybridity, spatiality and a 'new wave' remain very promising – perhaps most evident in a recent volume by Julie Seymour, Abigail Hackett and Lisa Procter.\n\nParagraph 4: Florida is home to two-thirds of the Puerto Rican population in the South. Florida is currently home to the fastest-growing Puerto Rican population of any state. Cubans and Puerto Ricans are Florida's largest Hispanic groups, though unlike the Cuban community which is nearly entirely located in the South Florida and Tampa Bay areas, the Puerto Rican population is far more spread-out and is present in large numbers in Central Florida, South Florida, and North Florida, having large populations in the metro areas of Orlando, Tampa, Miami, and Jacksonville, among other cities. South Florida has a large Puerto Rican population centered around the Miami metro area, yet are largely overlooked by Cuban dominance and the overall diversity of the Miami area, with large numbers in Miami, Hollywood, West Palm Beach, Homestead, North Miami, Boynton Beach, Coconut Creek, and Port St. Lucie. The west coast of Florida has significant Puerto Rican populations present in scattered areas, in cities such as, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Pinellas Park, Lakeland, Cape Coral, Lehigh Acres, and Fort Myers. Central Florida has the largest Puerto Rican population of any region in the state and the fastest-growing Puerto Rican population in the country. The Orlando metropolitan area is the center of the Puerto Rican population in Central Florida and there is large populations of Puerto Ricans throughout the region, with the largest populations in Orlando, Kissimmee, Poinciana, Buenaventura Lakes, Azalea Park, Meadow Woods, Pine Hills, Deltona, St. Cloud, Sanford, Apopka, Alafaya, Oak Ridge, Oviedo, Daytona Beach, and Palm Bay. Osceola County is the only county in the country where Puerto Ricans are the largest ancestral group. Puerto Ricans are also the vast majority of Hispanics in Volusia County. The I-4 corridor, extending from Daytona Beach to Tampa, is home to 500,000 Puerto Ricans. The I-4 corridor is politically considered the swing section of the state, yet Puerto Rican growth has created a Democratic registration advantage. Puerto Rican growth in Central Florida has also had a direct impact on the uninterrupted influence Cubans once had. In North Florida, there are significant Puerto Rican populations in Jacksonville, Orange Park, Ocala, Tallahassee, and Gainesville. Though, the most notable growth in North Florida has been in Clay County and the Jacksonville area. Though, the Puerto Rican population may not be as large as other parts of Florida, especially Central Florida, Puerto Ricans often make up the majority of Hispanics in many North Florida cities, due to lower percentages of Hispanics in North Florida.\n\nParagraph 5: From 1970 to 1985, Kessler was an investigative reporter for The Washington Post. In 1972, he won a George Polk Memorial award for Community Service because of two series of articles he wrote—one on conflicts of interest and mismanagement at Washington area non-profit hospitals, and a second series exposing kickbacks among lawyers, title insurance companies, realtors, and lenders in connection with real estate settlements, inflating the cost of buying homes. That Kessler series resulted in congressional passage in 1974 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which outlaws kickbacks for referral of settlement services in connection with real estate closings. For the two series, Kessler was named a Washingtonian of the Year for 1972 by  Washingtonian magazine. In 1979, Kessler  won a second Polk Award, this one for National Reporting for a series of articles exposing corruption in the General Services Administration; he won even though his editor, Ben Bradlee, had not submitted his stories for consideration. Kessler's Washington Post stories reporting that Lena Ferguson had been denied membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) because she is black led to her acceptance by the DAR,  appointment to head the DAR Scholarship Committee, and widespread changes in the organization's policies to increase membership by blacks.\n\nParagraph 6: Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Locadia was included in the PSV Eindhoven's pre–season tour in Poland after being called up Manager Dick Advocaat and helped the club win the Polish Masters. He was also handed the shirt number 19 for the first team. It was reported in August 2012 that Manager Advocaat was planning to loan out the player to get more playing time, but PSV Eindhoven's technical manager Marcel Brands decided to keep him. Locadia made his first appearance of the season as a starter in a KNVB Cup match against Achilles '29 on 27 September 2012 and he scored the second goal in the 3–0 win over the third-tier team. Three days later on 30 September 2012, Locadia made his Eredivisie debut against VVV-Venlo, entering the pitch in Venlo as a substitute in the 68th minute, and with only 22 minutes left in the game, he managed to score three goals in the 6–0 win over VVV-Venlo. Locadia became the first player to score a hat-trick in his Eredivisie debut since Harald Berg scored three goals in his debut game on 10 August 1969. A week after his debut hat-trick, Locadia was promoted to the first team and signed a new five-year contract with PSV which will keep him at the club until 2017. His performance led Manager Advocaat praising his attitude, saying: \"Locadia is very confident. He is not easily fooled.\" Locadia made his UEFA Europa League debut, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss against AIK on 8 November 2012. He then scored his fourth goal of the season, in a 6–1 win against NAC Breda on 22 December 2012. His next goal came on 2 February 2013 against ADO Den Haag when Locadia scored PSV Eindhoven's fifth goal of the game, in a 7–0 win. Three weeks later on 27 February 2013, he scored three goals in a 3–0 win over PEC Zwolle in the KNVB Cup semi-final. However, Locadia suffered a with tonsils problems while on international duty and was sidelined for a month after undergoing a surgery. He didn't make his return to the first team against NEC Nijmegen on 5 May 2013 and scored his fifth goal of the season, in a 4–2 win, helping the club finish second place in the league. Four days later in the final of the KNVB Beker against AZ Alkmaar on 9 May 2013, Locadia scored his sixth goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Locadia went on to make twenty–two appearances and scoring eleven times in all competitions.\n\nParagraph 7: Osteochondromas are long and slender, pedunculated on a stalk often taking the shape of a cauliflower. The cartilage cap is covered by fibrous perichondrium and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the osteochondroma, which is attached to the perichondrium of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma. Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and multiple osteochondromas have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11. About 70–75% of multiple osteochondromas are caused by point mutations, often involving deletion of single or multiple axons as found in 10% of all hereditary cases. In about 10–15% of all cases no genomic alterations are detected. The mechanism behind the formation of multiple osteochondroma is large genomic deletions of EXT1 and EXT2 genes. The identified mechanism behind solitary osteochondromas is the homozygous deletions of the EXT1 gene. However, the exact cause of osteochondroma is unknown. Additionally, the molecular basis of genetics and clinical variability of multiple osteochondroma as well as the underlying causes for the malignant transformation and the onset of osteochondroma in EXT negative patients is also currently unknown.\n\nParagraph 8: At the same time as it was beginning to prove its science, the company ignited a huge controversy with the proposal to create a research database - the Iceland Health Sector Database (or IHD for short) - containing copies of medical records from across the country's national health service. In December 1998, with lobbying from deCODE, the Icelandic Parliament passed the Act on Health Sector Database which permitted public bidding for the right of a company to create this health database and use it for commercial research and to support the national health system. The parliament shortly thereafter granted deCODE the right to create this database after the company made a successful bid to do so. Widely supported by the public and parliament, the IHD's openly commercial aims, and proposed inclusion of medical records data unless individuals opted out, unleashed vehement opposition played out in the local and international media, led by a group of Icelandic activists as well as a number of foreign bioethicists. Although the IHD was never built, the debate underscored the political challenges involved in enlisting an entire society in a scientific enterprise, especially one with the explicit aim of commercializing its discoveries. It also ensured that deCODE and its approach went from being a peripheral curiosity to one of the highest profile enterprises in the global effort to understand the human genome.\n\nParagraph 9: Martínez was a strong candidate to make the major-league team in  but was optioned to Pawtucket in late March. The Red Sox called him up on May 22 to replace the injured Scott Williamson, and Martínez made his major-league debut with Boston on May 22, 2004, in relief of another Martínez - Pedro. After a strong start, going 2–0 with a 1.12 appearances, Martínez was lit up in interleague play and the Red Sox optioned him back to Pawtucket in June when outfielder Trot Nixon came off the disabled list. Boston manager Terry Francona was optimistic about Martínez's future: \"I think he'll go back to Triple A and be a better pitcher. He'll be back here.\" Indeed, the Red Sox recalled Martínez on July 2 as Williamson returned to the disabled list. His return was, however, short lived: entering the 12th inning of a 3–3 tie with the Atlanta Braves, Martínez surrendered a game-winning three-run home run to Nick Green; the next day the Red Sox sent him back to Pawtucket and called up Jimmy Anderson. During his two stints with Boston, he made 11 relief appearances, going 2–1 with an 8.44 ERA and a save. At Pawtucket, in 38 games, he had a 3.74 ERA.\n\nParagraph 10: Charles II only reigned for a few months in Parma. In March 1848 revolution broke out in Parma supported by King Charles Albert of Sardinia. Ferdinando Carlo escaped from Parma, but was arrested in Cremona and taken as a prisoner in Milan where he remained for several months until the British government negotiated his release.   At this time he was described by a contemporary as \"Tall and slim with an open and merry countenance, a light-hearted, light-headed, careless young man\".   After a brief sojourn on the island of Malta, he traveled to Naples and then Livorno where he was joined by his wife Louise Marie who had just given birth to their first son while in exile in Florence. Then the family sought refuge in England. They settled in a cottage at Surbiton, south-west of London. Disraeli who met him at this time, described Ferdinando as \"a very droll man, exceedingly amusing and clever—a rattle, a mimic and gamboled in mind and body. He was a great tumbler and skilfully in all tour de force. Walking with the Queen at Windsor, I believed for the first time, he suddenly tumbled before Her Majesty the whole way she walked. She died with laughter and astonishment. He was less like a tyrant than any person I ever met; full of fun and humor\"."}

However, he later scored a touchdown and his first receiving touchdown of the season in subsequent games."], "answers": ["Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Pequeño Halcón joined CMLL in mid-2010 at the same time as the company introduced fellow Mini-Estrellas Cisne and Aéreo, although Cisne only made a few appearances for the promotion. In CMLL he is established as a Mini-Estrella as CMLL does not allow their workers to mix. As Pequeño Halcón he adopted ring gear that resembled that worn by his father, including spiked shoulder pads he wears for his introductions. His CMLL debut match took place on July 20, 2010, and saw him team up with Mini Maximo and Último Dragóncito to defeat Cisne, Pequeño Nitro and Pequeño Violencia. As part of CMLL's bicentennial celebrations, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Mexico's independence CMLL held two Torneo Bicentenario tournament one of which was for the Mini-Estrellas division. The winner of the tournament would be \"promoted\" to compete in the regular division going forward. The tournament took place over three Sundays in August, from August 10 to August 24. To qualify for the finale on August 24 a wrestler had to win an eight-man Torneo cibernetico to outlast his competitors. Pequeño Halcón competed in the second block of the tournament, but was the second person eliminated in the match. Halcón was one of 16 Mini-Estrellas to compete in a Ruleta de la Muerte, (\"Roulette of Death\"). In a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament tag teams face off in a single elimination tournament, but unlike traditional tournaments it is the losing team that advances in this case. The team that loses the tag team match final must immediately wrestle against each other in a Lucha de Apuestas match, where either their mask or their hair is on the line. Pequeño Halcón teamed up with Mini Maxmio in the fight to keep their mask or hair (in Mini Maximo's case) safe. In the first round they defeated the team of CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pequeño Olímpico and Shockercito, protecting their mask and hair. He entered the Mexico City version of the 2012 Pequeños Reyes del Aire (\"Little Kings of the Air\") tournament, but was eliminated early on in the 16-man torneo cibernetico match. On November 6, 2012, 12 competitors met in a special steel cage match where the loser of the match would be forced to unmask or have his hair shaved completely off. Pequeño Halcón was the first wrestler to climb over the top of the cage to the floor, thus keeping his mask safe. On April 6, 2014, at Arena Coliseo's 71st anniversary event, Halcón took part in a ten-man minis cage Lucha de Apuestas. In the end, Halcón was defeated by Astral, forcing him to unmask and reveal his identity.\n\nParagraph 2: In the 2000s, Jones began building a substantial body of photography work, concentrating primarily on landscapes. More recently, he traveled to southeast Asia, taking many portraits of villagers and religious Buddhist art.  In 2005, he recorded the EP, “BossAmerioca,” the first of its kind in which American and British popular songs that had been originally influenced by bossa nova in the 1960s, were redone by Jones with some top shelf Brazilian musicians such as Debora Watts, Dionisio Santos, Leco Reis and Helio Schiavo as well as the American jazz virtuosi Joel Frahm and Tim Collins. It was recorded in New York and he hopes to record many more songs that he has already arranged for these CD’s.  The authenticity of the EP was highly praised by many of the surviving original creators of bossa nova including Roberto Menescal, Carlos Lyra and Marcos Valle, and was played for audiences at both Toca do Vinicius, the bossa nova museum and store in Ipanema, and at the Vinicius Piano Bar in Ipanema, which is the most venerable existing standard bearer of bossa nova. The following year, he was asked to compose music for the off-Broadway play, \"The City That Cried Wolf,\" by the State of Play Theater Group at the New York Fringe Festival. He also was commissioned to compose music for several websites. In 2009, he assembled a third version of the group \"Sound Sculpture\" with Rob Thomas once again on violin, Ken Filiano on bass, Jay Rosen on drums and Joe Cruz on percussion, and performed at the world-famous Iridium Jazz Club in New York City. The concert received rave reviews and was recorded on both CD and DVD. The poet Jeff Schwartz documented the event in an original poem, which was eventually published in The Oakland Review.  Jones completed an important scholarly study on a work by Bob Dylan’s, entitled “Visions of Visions of Johanna,” which he is planning on publishing. In November and December 2011, one of his music compositions “Voyage Espagnole” was performed in Dallas by Bruce Patti of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and 2 different pianists.  It was also given to Chick Corea as a gift for his 70th birthday at the Blue Note Jazz Club.  And his collection of poetry, “The Cry of the Lonely, the Song of the Poet: Collected Poems 1971–2006” is due to be published in the spring of 2012.  Also being released in spring of 2012 is the CD, “Memories of the Future,” recently discovered virtuoso solo piano works originally recorded in 1981 and 1985 in Cleveland and New York.  Jones has been teaching the Chinese internal martial arts to private students and has given workshops throughout the world for many years. He intends to expand his involvement in teaching these arts in order to both keep the insights and achievements of past masters alive, and to help others attain good physical and mental health as well as quality, effective self-defense abilities.\n\nParagraph 3: Morgan signed a five-year contract worth $12 million for the first two years, $7.5 million of which guaranteed, and the last three years voidable by the Washington Redskins on March 13, 2012. By the start of the 2012 season, he was named the second starting wide receiver opposite of Pierre Garçon after competing with Leonard Hankerson for the starting flanker position. In Week 2 against the St. Louis Rams, he was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct during the Redskins' two-minute drive attempt in the fourth quarter to tie with or beat the Rams. After catching a pass on a third down and being tackled by Cortland Finnegan, Finnegan shoved Morgan while he was getting up and put his hand in Morgan's face. Morgan reacted by throwing the ball at Finnegan and the Redskins were then given a 15-yard penalty. Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff then attempted a 62-yard field goal on fourth down, missing and leaving the final score 31-28. Morgan was later fined $7,875 by the NFL for the penalty. On a play where Robert Griffin III rushed for 12 yards, the ball popped into the air as he was tackled, Morgan caught the ball and ran it 13 yards for a touchdown in the Week 13 win over the New York Giants. In the next game against the Baltimore Ravens, he scored his first receiving touchdown of the season.\n\nParagraph 4: These examples of applications took place during the 2018 Advanced Naval Technology exercises, in August at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport. The first example of unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by Northrop Grumman with their air drop sonobuoy's from a fire scout aircraft. Throughout the demonstration the company used the: e Iver3-580 (Northrop Grumman AUV) to display their vehicles ability to sweep for mines, while also displaying their real-time target automated recognition system. Another company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, presented their version of an unmanned underwater vehicle named Proteus. The Proteus is a dual-mode undersea vehicle developed by Huntington and Battelle, the company during the presentation displayed their unmanned underwater vehicle capabilities by conducting a full-kill demonstration on sea bed warfare. During the demonstration the vehicle utilized a synthetic aperture sonar which was attached to both the port and starboard of the craft, which allowed the unmanned underwater vehicle to identify the targets placed underwater and to ultimately eliminate them. Ross Lindman (director of operations at the company's technical solution's fleet support group) stated that \"The big significance of this is that we ran the full kill chain\". \"We ran a shortened version of an actual mission. We didn’t say, ‘Well we’re doing this part and you have to imagine this or that.’ We ran the whole thing to illustrate a capability that can be used in the near term.\" The final demonstration for unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by General Dynamics, the company showcased their cross-domain multi-platform UUV through a theater simulating warfare planning tool. Through the utilization of this simulation, they showed a Littoral combat ship along with two unmanned underwater vehicles. The goal of this exercise was to demonstrate the communication speed between the operator and the UUV. James Langevin, D-R.I., ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on emerging threats, stated in regard to this exercise \"What this is all driving to is for the warfare commander to be able to make the decisions that are based on what he thinks is high-confidence input quicker than his adversary can,\" he said. \"That’s the goal — we want to be able to … let them make warfare-related decisions quicker than anybody else out there.\" These exercises were conducted to showcase the applications of unmanned underwater vehicles within the military community, along with the innovations each company created to better suite these specific mission types.\n\nParagraph 5: Bourne's third and last major trip was perhaps his most ambitious; consisting of a six-month journey in the Himalayas with the goal of reaching and photographing the source of the Ganges. He left Simla on 3 July 1866, in the company of Dr. G.R. Playfair (brother of the famous English politician Dr. Lyon Playfair), and travelled with him through Kulu and Lahaul, over the Kunzum Pass into the Spiti valley, where they later parted company. Bourne then continued on alone (except for his forty porters!); over the Manirung Pass, where he took spectacular views of the 18,600 foot high pass; which held the record for the highest altitude photographs that had yet been taken for twenty years. Thence, down to the junction of the Spiti and Sutlej Rivers and on to Sungnam and the Buspa Valley. He then climbed up over the Neela Pass, and down into the Upper Ganges Valley, where he journeyed on up to the Gangotri Glacier. There he went on to photograph one of the prime sources of the Ganges, as it issued from the mouth of the glacial ice cave at Gaumukh. His return journey took in Agra, Mussoorie, Roorkee, Meerut and Naini Tal, and he arrived back in Simla, again in time for Christmas! He wrote extensively about his travels in the Himalayas (one of the very few photographers in India to do so), in a long series of letters, which appeared in The British Journal of Photography, between 1863 and 1870.\n\nParagraph 6: Wakeman wanted a unique show for King Arthur in England, his first UK shows since Crystal Palace, rather than a standard concert performance. An early idea of his was to perform the album at Tintagel Castle as part of a King Arthur Day event with a medieval pageant and jousting knights. Wakeman was informed the castle was unsuitable for concerts, so he suggested to his promoter, Harvey Goldsmith, the idea of staging the show in a field beside it with a large inflatable castle. After travelling to Tintagel to investigate the possibility, Goldsmith found the land was crown property and a series of letters to the Duchy of Cornwall about the show failed to generate a response. A show at Tintagel was abandoned, and Wakeman suggested Wembley Stadium but Goldsmith explained it was not feasible. The keyboardist suggested Wembley Arena, but booking the venue caused a problem as the Ice Follies were scheduled to perform afterwards and the arena had already become an ice rink. Goldsmith and Wakeman's management instead suggested a scaled down show at the Royal Albert Hall, but Wakeman insisted on Wembley, and subsequently told a Melody Maker reporter that he would be presenting King Arthur as an ice show, \"so there was no going back\".\n\nParagraph 7: On the other side of the mirror, the Doctor and Romana are reunited with Biroc in a stable, time-locked universe. A repentant Biroc explains they were the slave masters, travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets and subjugate their populations as slaves until the Gundan revolt. The Doctor and Romana are returned to the null space, and are immediately captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realise that the null space is shrinking as the distances between the gateway, the TARDIS, and slaver ship continue to decrease. Rorvik has ordered the crew to try to blast through the mirrors in gateway, believing it to be the way out, but the mirrors resist all attacks.  With the gateway and ship in visible distance of each other, Rorvik resorts to one last attempt to break the mirrors by using the exhaust of the ship's engines against them. While the Doctor warns that this action will be as doomed as the previous ones, Romana regroups with Lazlo and Adric, and together they free the remaining Tharils on the slaver ship. The TARDIS crew flee to the TARDIS as Rorvik initiates his plan—the blast from the engines is reflected by the mirrors back onto the ship, destroying it and its crew.\n\nParagraph 8: The Phillies were 47–58, 15 games behind the first-place Nationals, and 10 games behind the second wild card after their series against the Nationals on August 2. The Phillies started the month by taking 2 of 3 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game 3 victory was huge for Ryan Howard, who had struggled since coming off his injury. After getting booed by striking out when the game was tied in the 8th inning with the bases loaded, Ryan Howard came through by hitting an RBI single with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to win the game and the series. The victory also put them out of last place in the NL East for the first time since June 27. The Phillies then took 1 of 3 from the Braves, a team that they got swept by in the past 2 series. In game 1 of the series, the Phillies saw their sellout streak end when the Phillies did not have a sell-out crowd. This ended their streak at 257 games, the third-longest sellout streak in MLB history. The Phillies then took 2 of 3 from the St. Louis Cardinals and came back from 3 runs down to win game 3 in extra innings. The Phillies then also took 2 of 3 from the Miami Marlins. The Phillies then split the series at 2–2 against the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds. After their game 4 win against the Reds, the Phillies moved up to third place in the division for the first time since April 12. The Phillies then pulled off a three-game sweep of the Nationals, marking their second three-game sweep of the season. The Phillies would however take just 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. To finish the month, the Phillies would pull off a comeback win against the Braves in game 1 on August 31. The Phillies ended up taking 2 of 3 from that series. They could have swept the series, but the Phillies blew a 7–3 lead in the bottom of the 9th inning in game 3. The Phillies finished August by going 17–12, their best month of the season overall so far. However, Carlos Ruiz, who had been the star of the Phillies with his remarkable performance this season, had to sit out for 4–6 weeks because of a fractured knee that took a beating throughout the month. Ruiz was replaced by Erik Kratz due to catcher Brian Schneider also suffering an injury. This month also saw a huge improvement by Kyle Kendrick. After Charlie Manuel got really disappointed in an awful outing by Kyle in a 12–6 loss when he allowed 6 runs, he has been the hottest Phillies's pitcher since. Right away in his next outing, he shut the Miami Marlins out, allowing no runs. He did the same in his next outing against a normally strong Milwaukee Brewers offense. Although in his next outing Kyle allowed a 2-run home run against the Washington Nationals, Kendrick received his 3rd win in a row when the Phillies won 4–2. Kendrick picked up his fourth win in a row when the Phillies won 3–2 against the New York Mets.\n\nParagraph 9: A volume of gas can be economically stranded because it is remote from a market for natural gas, making construction of a pipeline prohibitively expensive.  Gases are expensive to transport over long distances, especially on scale. One obvious solution to this problem is to convert the gas (mainly methane) into liquid fuels such as methanol, which would be easier to transport. Despite intensive efforts, methods for the conversion of methane to methanol have not been established.  The crux of the problem is that the partial oxidation of methane to methanol is rapidly followed by further oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide, i.e. complete combustion. John Kerry said in 2022 that new investments in gas exploration and production - such as in Africa - risked stranding.\n\nParagraph 10: The IHB is jointly owned by Conrail Shared Assets Operations (51%) and Canadian Pacific Railway (49%). These shareholders trace their ownership stake in IHB to previous mergers and acquisitions in the railroad industry.  Conrail's ownership is traced back to the Penn Central Transportation Company and prior to that, the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad.  Canadian Pacific's ownership is through its subsidiary, the Soo Line, which inherited it from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the \"Milwaukee Road\"). Also, the IHB's northern terminus is the Milwaukee District/West Line in Franklin Park, Illinois, which is operated by Metra and Canadian Pacific."}

In 1937, while presenting a paper to a scientific conference in Rio de Janeiro, the young student met Brazilian physicist Mário Schenberg and was introduced by him in São Paulo to Italian physicists Luigi Fantappiè and Gleb Wataghin. All three were working on research in physics at the then recently created University of São Paulo, amid a climate of great intellectual excitement and a breeding ground for a bright young generation of what would become the élite of Brazilian physics, such as César Lattes, Oscar Sala, Roberto Salmeron, Jayme Tiomno and Marcelo Damy de Souza Santos. Encouraged to study physics by what he saw, Leite Lopes moved to Rio de Janeiro after hist graduation in 1939. He took the entrance examinations to the National Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Brazil in 1940 and graduated a bachelor in physics in 1942. Accepting an invitation by Carlos Chagas Filho, Leite Lopes started to work in the same year the Institute of Biophysics of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, but soon moved to the University of São Paulo to take up graduate studies in quantum mechanics with his teacher, friend and sponsor, Mário Schenberg. His main work during this time was on the calculation of Dirac's radiation field of electrons.\n\nParagraph 2: After running a mile down its limestone valley, the Leach reaches Northleach, the first settlement to which it gives its name. The river enters Northleach to the south west, where it gushes out of a Victorian conduit just below the Fosse Way. At this point it is also known as the Seven Springs. The site of the first watermill on the river is in a part of Northleach called Mill End. A section of the river is confined into mill race type stonework, close to the churchyard and runs behind houses marking the town boundary. The river can next be seen at a road bridge at the end of the town. It is still little more than ditch-sized, and as such continues down the valley to the hamlet of Eastington running alongside a lane before passing through a culvert and away through grazing land.\n\nParagraph 3: Just Adventure described Pilgrim as a \"little-known title\", noting that by the time of the release of its sequel, The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin in 1999, Pilgrim had still not been released in North America. It noted that there were three potential culprits for the gaming \"gem\" suffering lack of recognition: little to no marketing by Arxel Tribe, the publisher not understanding how to sell the product, and the gaming industry simply being apathetic toward adventure games at the time. Game coder Marcin Mierzejewski Zenzire later argued that while the title was a decent success among adventure fans and created a reasonable amount of media buzz, Arxel Tribe used the boom in popularity to promote themselves rather than the game. This meant a \"comparatively small number of copies was [sic] printed and therefore sold out almost immediately\". SK Online wrote that the game was only a half-hearted success, partly because of the lack of advertising, but also because it had some technical deficiencies when compared to its contemporaries. Clovis of Gameboomers noted that during its rollout, there were \"significant delays in delivery\". Just Adventure reported that Pilgrim was originally supposed to be included as a bonus feature in the release of The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin, but that this idea was later abandoned, describing it as \"yet another marketing mistake\". The article, published between Pilgrims original and re-releases, further explained that while the game was very rare, it could occasionally be found on eBay and the Game Trading Zone. In its review of The Secrets of Alamut in July 2001, Just Adventure wrote that Pilgrim had experienced a \"rejuvenation in sales\" in the time since it had been listed it in \"The Ten Best Games That (Almost) No One Has Ever Played\" article. Despite that, in 2002, Tap Repeatedly still lamented that the game had sunk into relative obscurity between its 1998 and 2001 releases. On the contrary, VGDb said the game was a \"great success\", while Arxel Tribe asserted that their game had been recognised by both players and critics for its originality and being faithful to Coelho's work. Guillaume de Fondaumiere told Game.EXE that the game sold \"surprisingly well\", and that due to the efforts of Infogrames, 40,000 copies were sold in France alone. Relations Presse asserted that the game received an impressive number of articles in the public press as a result of their public relations stunt at the Ljubljana castle.\n\nParagraph 4: The ability of the blue catfish to tolerate a wide range of climates and brackish water has allowed it to thrive in Virginia's rivers, lakes, tributaries, and the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, the relatively low mortality rate, large body size, wide range of species preyed upon, and success as a predator has resulted in the blue catfish being considered a problematic invasive species in Virginia. Since their introduction in Virginia waters in the 1970s, blue catfish populations have exploded. Recent electrofishing studies have documented capture rates in excess of 6,000 fish/hr, whereas studies from the native range show peak electrofishing capture rates of 700 fish/hr. Clearly, blue catfish are a dominant species within the freshwater and oligohaline portions of Virginia's tidal rivers. The introduction of blue catfish in Virginia's tidal rivers was thought to have negative impacts on anadromous American shad, blueback herring, and alewife; however, predation of these species by blue catfish has been demonstrated to be minimal. Much of the narrative that has been built around the species as a dangerous apex predator in the Chesapeake Bay is simply not true. Researchers from Virginia Tech have found the species to be mostly herbivorous and omnivorous, with diets consisting largely of hydrilla and Asian clams, both of which are invasive to the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish do eat blue crabs with some regularity, which is problematic because blue crabs represent the most valuable fishery in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nParagraph 5: Dale's death was adulated by commentators, who affirmed that it was a gruesome and emotional scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, \"Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse.\" Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: \"It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world.\" Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought that it was among the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was \"riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death\". Handlen remarked: \"It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now.\" Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as \"violent\", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; \"That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off.\" Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that \"when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner.\" Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.\n\nParagraph 6: Staines was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and on its Supreme Council from 1921 to 1922. He served as Quartermaster General in the GPO during the 1916 Easter Rising and was later interned with his fellow insurgents at Frongoch internment camp. These men were served with internment orders under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which stated that they were \"suspected of having honoured, promoted or assisted an armed insurrection against His Majesty\". This meant that there were no charges, no court appearances and no pleas. Staines was elected Commandant of the prisoners after the former Commandant J. J. O'Connell was sent to Reading Gaol on 30 June. W.J. Brennan-Whitmore described Staines as: \"a highly efficient officer who earned the love and respect of every individual prisoner.\" The attempts to conscript men in Frongoch to the British Army proved to be a serious source of disagreement between the prisoners and the camp authorities. The prisoners felt that it was ludicrous to expect Irish rebels to fight for Britain and the Crown. In addition, they were concerned that acceptance of conscription in Frongoch might be a prelude to the introduction of conscription in Ireland. Roughly sixty men in Frongoch had lived in Great Britain before the Rising and they were accordingly deemed liable for conscription. Staines, whom W. J. Brennan-Whitmore describes as maintaining \"a very difficult position with remarkable efficiency and tact\" throughout the conscription troubles which took place in Frongoch, took up a very resolute attitude on the question of identification. He asked Colonel F.A. Heygate-Lambert, Camp Commandant if he expected the prisoner leaders to identify comrades of theirs for military service in the British Army. To this Heygate-Lambert replied that it was the leaders' duty to identify men for all purposes. Staines retorted that by identifying the men for military service they would be lowering themselves to the level of spies and informers.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1828, Hudson began fitting out for what was to be her only cruise, and during this period was inspected by President John Quincy Adams and his entourage. The frigate sailed from New York on 28 September 1828 to serve as Commodore John Orde Creigton's flagship in the Brazil Squadron. In company with , she touched at New London, Connecticut for supplies and ammunition before turning south to reach Rio de Janeiro on 29 November to help eradicate the insidious traffic in slaves along those shores. From there Hudson conducted several patrols along the South American coast, stopping and boarding for inspection American as well as foreign ships. She also served as a harbor patrol vessel at Montevideo and Rio and cruised to Bahia and St. Catherine during her three years on station.\n\nParagraph 8: Okubo was born in Kanda, Fukuoka on 9 June 1982. After graduating from high school, he joined J1 League club Cerezo Osaka in 2001. He played many matches as forward and offensive midfielder from first season. However Cerezo finished at the bottom place in 2001 season and was relegated to J2 League. In 2002 season, he scored 18 goals which was the second top scorer and Cerezo reached the second place and was returned to J1 in a year. From 2003, he scored more than 15 goals in J1. He was also selected Asian Young Footballer of the Year award in 2003.\n\nParagraph 9: The original circuit was  long and was run on streets through different populated areas. The start and finish straight ran along the sea shore. After three fast corners the course followed a road – which is now called Molteno Drive – that would later also be part of the shorter new circuit. Moving further east the course entered the West Bank Village on Strand Street before turning north onto Bank Street and then west on Military Road. There the track moved through the areas Fort Glamorgan and Gately. Military Road changed into Settlers Way at the height of Woodbrook and Greenfields. After driving through what is now the East London Airport (not built at the time), the course turned south at the far west point onto Prince George Street and led with a relatively long series of twisty turns and one hairpin at the end back to the main straight.\n\nParagraph 10: The medical missionary work in this sensitive border town was started in the year 1894 by the Presbyterian Church of United States. Rev. Janvier Newton and his wife Mrs. Frances on whom the hospital is named arrived in Firozpur in the year 1877. The same year i.e. 1877 Rev. Janvier had to return to US for health reasons. He took a two years condensed medical course at the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia. Although this was not long enough time to get medical degree, it qualified him to do much for the benefit of the sick. In 1882 when he took charge of the Mission work in Firozpur, he opened a small dispensary in Firozpur City and daily treated a number of patients during summer, while in winter he connected medical work with his preaching. He traveled to the surrounding villages on a camel, back carrying his saddle bags of medicines and equipment. He worked mainly among men. Mrs. Frances, Dr. Newton's wife on whom the hospital is named, was much concerned about the women as there was no medical facility for them. She started running a dispensary for women and children from her residence. Later on, her daughter after taking a short medical course in America joined her. It was the mid 1880s that this dispensary from their home started functioning. When she had gone to US for leave and lying on sick bed in the Women's hospital, Philadelphia, Mrs. Frances Newton thought of building a hospital for the women and children of Firozpur area. She started talking about this and praying about it. The result was $2000/- collected to build the hospital for women and children. That was the beginning of Frances Newton Hospital and a 50-bed hospital was finally opened in 1894, and later on School of Nursing was opened in 1923. The first fully trained Missionary doctor that came out to the Frances Newton Hospital, Firozpur was Dr. Maud Allen from California. She was the Medical Superintendent of the hospital for 30 years. She owned a car which was very very rare thing ‘Model-T Ford’. She was an outstanding doctor and liked by all. Dr. Grace Edwards was the next missionary to be the Medical Superintendent for the next six years. She got married and Dr. Dorothy Ferris took charge of the hospital in 1936. Dr. Ferris, a graduate from the University of Cincinnati and a short course at the Columbus College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, before coming to India. She spent a year in Language schools."}

Eddleman initially enrolled at the University of Illinois but was called to join the Army Air Corps in January 1943. He was stationed in Miami Beach and served as a physical trainer for new cadets. While in Florida, he suffered a serious foot injury during a beach volleyball game. After approximately eighteen months, Eddleman returned to his home state and was stationed at Scott Field near Belleville, Illinois. His final destination was Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he played basketball for the Kittyhawks, a highly regarded military service \"all-star\" team. During his time with the Kittyhawks, Eddleman was named to the College All-Star team and played games across the country, including a memorable victory against the Harlem Globetrotters in 1945.

Haal comes from the name of the farm estate \"Hahlegården\". In the Knighthood Letter, signed by Queen Christina, the family name was written in two different ways — first \"Gyllenhahl\" and then \"Gyllenhaal\". On the copperplate with his coat of arms now hanging in the House of Nobility (Riddarhuset) in Stockholm, it is spelled \"Gyllenhahl\". Such ambiguities are typical of the time; it would be several generations before Swedish spelling was more strictly regulated.

Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out. Avery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nParagraph 3: The Illuminati's appearance was confirmed officially in March; and features actors portraying new versions of their characters from previous projects: Stewart plays a new version of Xavier that combines elements from his previous performances, including a line of dialogue from X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), with elements from X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997); Ejiofor plays a new version of Mordo; Hayley Atwell portrays Captain Carter after voicing the What If...? version; Lashana Lynch plays a different version of Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel from the one she portrayed in Captain Marvel (2019); and Anson Mount portrays an alternate version of Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt from his role in Marvel's ABC television series Inhumans (2017). Also in the group is John Krasinski as Fantastic Four member Reed Richards. Krasinski had been a popular suggestion for the role by fans for some time, especially since the announcement of a new Fantastic Four film set in the MCU. When Lynch was approached to return, she assumed she would be playing an ancestor of Rambeau and was surprised to learn she would be an alternate version of Captain Marvel. The Illuminati sequence was filmed in pieces, with many of the actors not being on set together. Krasinski's footage was filmed during reshoots to replace a planned cameo appearance by Daniel Craig, who chose not to film the role because he did not believe a single day of filming was worth the risk of catching COVID-19 and spreading it to his family. Craig was reportedly set to portray the character Balder the Brave in the scene. Olsen never actually met Krasinski while shooting the scene in which Scarlet Witch kills Richards; Olsen filmed the scene instead with a stand-in. Waldron said the final line-up of the Illuminati was similar to the one in his first draft, but with some other suggestions coming from Feige. Waldron considered including Namor, a member of the Illuminati in the comics, but Marvel had other plans for him in the MCU; Waldron's first draft also included an Earth-838 counterpart of Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne / The Wasp as a member of the Illuminati, who would have been killed by Maximoff clapping her hands to kill her. Storyboards by artist Soren Bendt for the Illuminati massacre scene suggest that, in addition to Balder the Brave, an Earth-838 counterpart of Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger, who was previously portrayed by Jeff Bridges in Iron Man (2008), was also considered for the group's lineup. There were also rumors that Tom Cruise would be portraying an alternate version of Tony Stark / Iron Man known as Superior Iron Man in the film after being in contention for the role back in the 1990s before Robert Downey Jr. was cast as the title character in 2006. Waldron expressed interest in the idea, but Cruise was never approached due to his filming schedule for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) and Part Two (2024). Other rumors about potential cameos included an appearance of Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Wade Wilson / Deadpool from Fox's Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018); Waldron confirmed there had been discussions about bringing Reynolds in to play Deadpool before they decided that the film was not \"the right place\" to feature him. Another character introduced in the film is Clea, with Charlize Theron cast in the role. Waldron said they wanted to include her in the film but felt they needed to resolve Strange's relationship with Christine Palmer first, so the character's introduction was saved for the mid-credits scene to set her up as a potential new love interest in a future story.\n\nParagraph 4: In the fall of 1942, Eddleman enrolled at the University of Illinois, playing on both the freshman football and basketball teams. However, in January 1943 Eddleman was called to military duty during World War II. He was placed in the Army Air Corps and, after being sent to Fort Sheridan in Chicago for basic training, he was stationed in Miami Beach where he was assigned as a physical trainer for new cadets, all while still being only 20 years of age. It was in Florida that he would suffer the most serious injury of his time in the military as during a beach volleyball game, Eddleman broke his right foot. Following approximately eighteen months in Florida, Eddleman returned to his home state near Belleville, Illinois stationed at Scott Field. His final destination during his military service was Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he played basketball for the Kittyhawks, a military service \"all-star\" team regarded as one of the greatest in the nation. While playing for the Kittyhawks, he was named to the College All-Star team composed of the best college players in the country. The team played games around the country, however, one particularly memorable game was when the Kittyhawks beat the Harlem Globetrotters in 1945. Eddleman would close out his military service in the Fall of 1946, transitioning back to the life of a college student athlete.\n\nParagraph 5: Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating \"Mass Raja Ravi Teja has got an unofficial promotion as Mass Maharaja as per the titles of this film.

The director purely depends on the energy levels of Ravi Teja and the comedy angle. Ravi Teja proves that he can hold the audience purely with his high-energy levels in action, comedy and romance scenes. He is the life and blood of the movie. You can't go wrong with a title as racy as Mirapakay.

Christians from nearby villages came to seize arms from the Jews, and when they refused a number of them were thrown into the Ros River, though many were saved by residents of Sokolivka who then assisted them in chasing off the bandits. On another occasion a group of 150 bandits held the shtetl hostage and demanded 500,000 rubles and all of the Jews clothing. Sokolivka's residents again came to the rescue, alerting a troop of Bolsheviks nearby who routed out the bandits under its Jewish commander. However, such luck would not last. In the night the bandits returned and began looting the town. At daylight, the bandits seized all the town's young men, dragging them into a synagogue and imprisoning them there. They then demanded a \"war tax\" of no less than a million rubles to be delivered in a matter of two hours. As the money could not be procured, every two hours Jews were taken from the synagogue and murdered in groups of 10. The Jews amassed all they could and delivered a little more than half of the bandits' demanded amount, in response the bandits took the money but refused to release their hostages. They began looting stores, shooting men, raping women, whipping Jewish children. At sunset they began to leave Justingrad, taking those who remained in the synagogue as captives. At the town's edge, the bandits were confronted by the Green armies, but instead of rescuing the civilians they merely warned the bandits not to aid the Bolsheviks across the river. Instead the Jews were murdered and thrown into the river, some parents ran to the bridge connecting Justingrad and Sokolivka and begged for their children's release, they too were killed. When the captives begged the Green armies to aid them, even offering themselves as soldiers, they ordered the bandits to kill them quicker. More than 150 people were killed. \n\nParagraph 9: Matanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas. Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519. Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous Escalera conspiracy (discovered in late 1843). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the Spanish–American War. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on April 25, 1898, just after the beginning of the war.\n\nParagraph 10: This episode, like many routine Christmas specials, has a rhyming narration akin to a storybook. It begins in a forest, where Stan discovers a group of talking animals, known as the Woodland Critters, consisting of Squirrely the Squirrel, Rabbity the Rabbit, Raccoony the Raccoon, Beavery the Beaver, Beary the Bear, Porcupiney the Porcupine, Skunky the Skunk, Foxy the Fox, Deery the Deer, Woodpeckery the Woodpecker, Mousey the Mouse, and Chickadee-y the Chickadee are building a Christmas tree. They convince a surprised but apathetic Stan to help make a star for it, after which he goes home. That night, they wake him in his room and explain that Porcupiney is pregnant with the creatures' savior. Though drowsy and annoyed, Stan agrees to help them build a manger for the baby. As he finishes, however, another problem appears in the form of a mountain lion, which apparently eats every pregnant Critter to prevent their Savior's birth. Exasperated, Stan goes to the cave where the mountain lion lives and manages to kill it, but is dismayed to learn that the lion was the mother of three newly orphaned cubs. He is further horrified to learn that the Woodland Critters are actually Satanists and that their \"Savior\" is the Antichrist. They celebrate Stan's victory by sacrificing Rabbity, devouring his flesh, and having an orgy in his blood."}

The 4 May 1990 declaration of independence (reinstating the 1920 constitution subject to a transitional period) by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR affirmed that the restored Republic of Latvia would base its relations with the Russian Federation on the treaty principle. In January 1991, the Russian Federation (while still in the USSR) and Latvia signed a document regulating their bilateral relations. The Latvian delegation attempted to include a reference to the 1920 treaty but the Russian delegation objected. In essence, Russia views Latvia as a newly independent country and consistently refuses to acknowledge that Latvia was occupied and illegally incorporated into the USSR, while Latvia insists upon the legal continuity of Latvian state occupied in 1940. Key players in post-war politics in the West never recognised or at least questioned the legality of the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR, but there is pressure on both countries to resolve the issue. This can be seen on the example of their attitude towards events from the beginning of the 20th century in Latvia. Thus, the European Community, for example, did not use the term \"recognition\" but referred to \"the restoration of sovereignty and independence\" when restoring diplomatic relations in 1991; the US to \"the culmination of the USA’s 52 year refusal to accept the forcible incorporation of the independent Baltic States by the USSR\".

Her relics had rested in the catacombs of Domitilla in Rome until 757 when Pope Paul I translated her body to St Peter’s in the circular mausoleum called thereafter of St Petronilla. The saint was named by the same Pope protector and patron of the French Kings to reward Pepin the Short of his service to the Papacy in front of the Lombard invasion. When the Rotunda of St Petronilla was demolished during the construction of the new St Peter, her body was translated to a new altar within the new church (1606).

Near to the right is Oxton Hall, home of Humphrey Smith. At Oxton the road rejoins the former route. On the eastbound side is the Total Bilbrough Filling Station, with the York East former Little Chef and Travelodge at the point where the Roman road (and Ebor Way) join from the west, briefly following the road. In February 2004, work began on a new £11 million flyover at the Colton Lane/Bilbrough Top junction, allowing for the closing of the central reserve. The central reserve had long been an accident blackspot, and residents of the local villages had campaigned for its closure. The flyover was opened on 9 June 2005 by Dr Stephen Ladyman. The BP Bilbrough Top Service Station on the west-bound side was built as well, with a McDonald's. At the turn-off for Askham Richard, the road enters the City of York next to the Buckles Inn. On the left is Askham Bryan College (agricultural), then Copmanthorpe is on the right, followed by Bishopthorpe (where the Archbishop of York lives). There is a junction for York's northern bypass (A1237), which was built in the late 1980s, and on the left is Pike Hills golf club and Askham Bogs nature reserve where the road is followed by NCN 66. The East Coast Main Line (Selby Diversion) passes under the A1036 junction for York to the left. To the east of the junction, the former ECML (through Selby, now NCN 65) is crossed, south of York College. The road then crosses the River Ouse. The  £12 million dual carriageway York Bypass opened in April 1976. It passes under the B1222 and meets the A19 at the Fulford Interchange, near the headquarters of Persimmon plc, and is crossed by the Minster Way, then the Wilberforce Way.\n\nParagraph 5:  A planet, the most common setting of his robot short stories. Earth is the planet upon which humans have lived for longer than anyone remembers. Earth features in one of several Origin Myths found throughout the Galactic Empire. Its history, however, is shrouded in the mists of time. Earth was the third planet from its sun (called Sol) and had one large moon (Luna). From millions of years BC to the early Galactic Era, Earth was one of the most, if not the most, important planets in the galaxy, being one of the only planets to ever develop life without being colonized by other worlds, and being the origin planet of the human race, who would go on to dominate the galaxy through the Galactic Empire. Around 65,000,000 BC, the dinosaurs, the original dominant race of Earth, were killed by a race of small intelligent lizards armed with guns, which either left Earth or died out. Eventually, humans evolved on the planet. Up until the 20th century AD, the human race progressed, having wars and developing technology, experiencing the ups and downs of civilization, but nothing extremely radical happened, and, most importantly, no one made an attempt to leave Earth and colonize new worlds. In the early 20th century, two world wars were endured, WW1 in the 1910s and WW2 in the 1940s. Eventually, in 1973, the human race reached for the moon. The Prometheus failed, but, after some complicated series of events, the New Prometheus reached the moon in 1978, achieving the goal of leaving Earth, if only slightly. From around 1979 to 1982, WW3 took place, ending nationalism, and splitting Earth into Regions. From there, the planet experienced a new renaissance, developing positronic brains in the 1980s and 1990s, governed by the Three Laws of Robotics. One of the most important early pioneers in robotics was Susan Calvin (1982-2064), who was the first and chief robopsychologist at US Robots and Mechanical Men from 2007 to 2058. Robots eventually grew very advanced. In 2065, Earth colonized the first extrasolar world, Aurora, the World of the Dawn. This was the first of the great Spacer Worlds, which were colonized over thousands of years across the stars. Around 3720, they rebelled against Earth, winning the Three-Week War, and would become higher in society than Earth. In 4724, detective Elijah Baley managed to allow the colonization of new worlds by Earth, which had been suppressed, and the Settler worlds were made. These were threatened in 4922 but were saved due to the efforts of Gladia Solaria, R. Daneel Olivaw and R. Giskard Reventlov, at the cost of Earth being made radioactive by Levular Mandamus. Eventually, the Settler worlds spread across the galaxy, outnumbering the Spacer worlds greatly, and Earth sank into unimportance, but was still known of and not looked down on. 1,000 years into the radioactivity, it was believed to be the result of a nuclear war. Thousands of years later, in the year 500 of the Foundation Era, Daneel Olivaw was on the Moon of Earth and encountered Golan Trevize.\n\nParagraph 6: The main event was the third week in a row that Los Ingobernables had faced some combination of wrestlers form Los Guerreros Lagunero and the second week in a row that La Máscara, La Sombra and Rush faced Gran Guerrero, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero specifically as part of a longer-running storyline between the two factions. Los Ingobernables came to the ring wearing creepy masks, hoodies and pants instead of their normal wrestling gear, giving the impression of more of a street gang than a wrestling team. The majority of the in-ring action centered around Último Guerrero and Rush as they focused primarily on each other throughout the match, building to the already announced singles match between the two the following week. In the third and deciding fall La Máscara and La Sombra held Último Guerrero still, allowing Rush to run across the ring and land a foul kick on Último Guerrero in front of the referee. This led to the disqualification loss for Los Ingobernables, but the trio showed once again that they cared less about winning the match and more about inflicting pain on their opponents. Over the years Volador Jr. has made it a habit to sometimes wear ring gear that resembles various super heroes, a tradition he continued in the semi-main event as he came to the ring looking like Spider-Man as he appeared on the Future Foundation storyline. Volador Jr. teamed up with Titán and Valiente, only to lose to the trio known as La Fuerza TRT (\"The TRT Power\"; El Terrible, Rey Bucanero and Vangelis) who win the first and the last fall to win the whole match. The fourth match of the evening was a match type called a Match Relampago (\"Lighting Match\"), a one fall match with a 10 minute time limit. The Lighting Match saw former rivals Máximo and Rey Escorpión face off, playing off a longer-running storyline between the two. On August 18, 2013 Rey Escorpión defeated Máximo's father Brazo de Plata in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, after which Brazo de Plata was shaved bald as a result. Brazo de Plata lost when Máximo tried to interfere and it cost his father the match. In subsequent months the feud moved on to Máximo trying to get revenge for his father against Rey Escorpión. The storyline included a match for Rey Escorpión's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, won by  against Máximo. In the months following the title match the focus seemed to shift away from their rivalry, but on October 25 it was rekindled as the two fought a very intense match, won by Máximo, followed by him making challenges for Rey Escorpión's championship once more. Like Volador Jr., the rudo (\"the Bad guy\") Mephisto had on several occasions patterned his ring gear on characters from comic books, in his case particularly super villains. For the October 25 show Mephisto wrestled in an outfit and mask that resembled a Zombie Batman character. Mephisto teamed up with regular partner Ephesto and a man who was starting to team with the two more and more, Hechicero as the team took on rookie Dragon Lee and two-thirds of Los Reyes de la Atlantida (\"The kings of the Atlantis\"; Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.). The teams split the first two falls between them in quick fashion, while the third fall was the longest of the match, longer than the first two falls combined, and saw Hechicero and Guerrero Maya, Jr. square off on several occasions, possibly sowing the seeds for a future storyline.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1939, while he was performing his military service in the Navy, he took part in several matches in the team of the Navy, played on the field of basins, putting on a good display, despite weighing 90 kg. He was noted by some observers of Venezia, who after various stresses succeeded in getting him to tryout; according to another source, a naval officer who was a fan of Venezia, admired the skill of Valentino and offered him to the Lagunari. At the trial, which he showed up and played barefoot, having left his boots intentionally at home not to ruin them. He convinced everyone, especially the manager Giuseppe Girani to purchase him. After a few months in the reserve team, which participated in its own championship, he was hired on 1 January 1940 for 50,000 lire. He made his debut in Serie A on 31 March 1940, in a 1–0 defeat away to Lazio, entering as a substitute for the center forward Francesco Pernigo, and kept his place in the starting lineup on his own merits. He played in all five of the remaining league games, often in the middle of the attack, creating a goal on the penultimate day against Bari, guaranteeing Venezia mathematical safety from relegation. In a Coppa Italia round of 16 defeat against Modena that ended 3–1, he would also score his team's only goal.\n\nParagraph 8: DDaddy's Girls: This CBS series followed Dudley Walker (Dudley Moore), the owner of a New York fashion house who loses his wife and his business partner when, after a years-long secret affair, they run off together leaving him as the primary caretaker to his three daughters. The series is notable as the first in which a gay principal character was played by an openly gay actor. Harvey Fierstein played Dennis Sinclair, a high-strung designer at Walker's firm. Although Fierstein earned praise for his performance, Daddy's Girls was hated by critics. New York magazine called the series \"Despised, reviled.\" Entertainment Weekly, somewhat prophetically, found Moore to be \"wan and confused.\" The Dallas Morning News could only say that \"Daddy's Girls isn't horrendously bad\" but predicted that it would not last until Christmas. Indeed, the series was placed \"on hiatus\" after only three episodes aired and never returned. Moore never returned to television; he was later diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, which Moore later cited as the cause of his difficulties on the set of the show.Dads: This 2013 Fox multicamera sitcom from Seth MacFarlane received scathing reviews from critics, receiving a score of 15 out of 100 on Metacritic and 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. The network used extracts of the negative reviews (\"offensive\", \"reprehensible\", \"morally wrong\") to promote the show. On May 7, 2014, Fox cancelled it after only one season.Delilah: The series was CBC's first prime-time sitcom, but it generally received poor reviews and negative audience reception. It was cancelled after a single 13-episode season in an era when Canadian content requirements made canceling Canadian programs after so few episodes a rarity. Delilah was one of several CBC flops during the early 1970s, including Corwin and McQueen, the product of inferior creativity. However, CBC's next sitcom, King of Kensington, fared much better and became a multi-year success. Toronto Star television critic Jim Bawden declared the series as the \"Worst Canadian Sitcom\", declaring the script writing to be \"appalling\" and discovered an absence of laughter from the audience when he attended a taping of an episode.Don't Call Me Charlie!: Debuting in a US fall 1962 season among a number of sitcoms with wildly unrealistic fantasy premises (The Jetsons and The Beverly Hillbillies would be the only two new sitcoms of that year to have any sort of afterlife), the sitcom featuring a rural veterinarian mistakenly drafted into the armed forces received a scathing review from Rick Du Brow at the time, who chided those responsible for calling the show a comedy, noted that the star of the series was a poor actor, and publicly questioned setting the series in Paris, France, despite having nothing to do with that city (noting that the show eliminated most traces to France after Charles de Gaulle returned to the Presidency). The show was pulled from air partway through its lone season with eight episodes left unaired.\n\nParagraph 9: For a variety of animals, the toxicity of methyl fluoroacetate has been determined orally and through subcutaneous injection. The dosage ranges from 0.1 mg/kg in dogs to 10–12 mg/kg in monkeys indicating considerable variation. An order of decreasing susceptibility has been determined within these animals which is: dog, guinea-pig, cat, rabbit, goat, then likely horse, rat, mouse, and monkey. For the rat and mouse, the toxicity by inhalation has been investigated more fully than for other animals. The LD50 for the rat and mouse are 450 mg./cu.m. and above 1,000 mg./cu.m. for 5 minutes, respectively. In dogs, guinea-pigs, cats, rabbits, goats, horses, rats, mouses and monkeys the pharmacological effects of this substance have been investigated by mouth and by injection. Methyl fluoroacetate causes progressive depression of respiration and is a convulsant poison, in most animals. When applied to the skin it is not toxic, yet through inhalation, injection and by mouth it is. For the rat, cat and the rhesus monkey, the effects of methyl fluoroacetate have been determined similar to those of nicotine, strychnine, leptazol, picrotoxin, and electrically induced convulsions. The convulsive pattern is considered to be similar to that of leptazol. Little besides signs of asphyxia is found post-mortem in these animals. Estimations have been made for blood sugar, hemoglobin, plasma proteins, non-protein nitrogen, and serum potassium, calcium, chloride, and inorganic phosphate in a small number of rabbits, dogs, and goats. Blood changes include a rise of 20 to 60% in hemoglobin, a rise of up to 90% in blood sugar, a rise of 70 to 130% in inorganic phosphate and a less significant rise in serum potassium with a terminal rise in non-protein nitrogen and potassium. The whole central nervous system is affected by methyl fluoroacetate just like with leptazol, with the higher centers being more sensitive than the lower ones. Small doses of methyl fluoroacetate have little effect on blood pressure yet in large doses it has an action similar to nicotine. It further stimulates the rate and volume of respiration and then causes failure of the respiration, probably central in origin as seen through graphic records. The knee jerk reaction appears to be accentuated through methyl fluoroacetate until convulsions occur due to the irradiation of the stimuli being so facilitated. Nervous conduction is increased and the threshold stimulus lessened in the reflex arc of a spinal cat. Methyl fluoroacetate reduces the electric convulsive threshold about 10 times in rats. The difficulties of treatments are stressed as methyl fluoroacetate is both a powerful convulsant and a respiratory depressant, yet suggestions for treatment in man are made. Methyl fluoroacetate presents a serious hazard as a food and water contaminant in the case that it is used as a poison against rodents and other vermin, as it is not easily detected or destroyed and is equally toxic by mouth and by injection.\n\nParagraph 10: Panic buying became a major international phenomenon in February and March 2020 during the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued in smaller, more localized waves throughout during sporadic lockdowns across the world. Stores around the world were depleted of items such as face masks, food, bottled water, milk, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, antibacterial wipes and painkillers. As a result, many retailers rationed the sale of these items. Online retailers eBay and Amazon began to pull certain items listed for sale by third parties such as toilet paper, face masks, pasta, canned vegetables, hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes over price gouging concerns. As a result, Amazon restricted the sale of these items and others (such as thermometers and ventilators) to healthcare professionals and government agencies.  Additionally, panic renting of self-storage units took place during the onset of the pandemic. The massive buyouts of toilet paper caused bewilderment and confusion from the public. Images of empty shelves of toilet paper were shared on social media in many countries around the world, e.g. Australia, United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. In Australia, two women were charged over a physical altercation over toilet paper at a supermarket. The severity of the panic buying drew criticism; particularly from Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison, calling for Australians to \"stop it\". Research on this specific social phenomenon of toilet paper hoarding suggested that social media had played a crucial role in stimulating mass-anxiety and panic. Social media research found that many people posting about toilet paper panic buying were negative, either expressing anger or frustration over the frantic situation. This high amount of negative viral posts could act as an emotional trigger of anxiety and panic, spontaneously spreading fear and fueling psychological reactions in midst of the crisis. It may have triggered a snowball effect in the public, encouraged by the images and videos of empty shelves and people fighting over toilet rolls."}

Theseus, despite his status as a foreign entity in an intensely nationalistic city-state (he would later be named an honorary citizen in the 5th century BCE), became representative of many essential Athenian traits. In fact, it has even been proposed that his actions in and his journey to Crete came to represent the naval power of the Athenians after the Persian Wars. This reveals the dynamic nature of Athenian festivals, as new understandings and depictions of founding myths may in turn lead to new understandings of the festival. The Pyanopsia and other Theseus-based Greek festivals may not have only symbolically thanked Apollo for the his actions and agricultural abundance, but also represented the values of their founders. The Pyanopsia also involved the worship of the Horae - the daughters of Themis, the goddess of divine law and order. By being worshipped at the Pyanopsia and a spring festival called the Thargelia, the Horai – Eunomia (well ordering) and Dike (right and justice) – are revealed as being connected to agriculture and vegetation.\n\nParagraph 2: In early Indian literary works, Tamralipta, with its other \"dialectical variants,\" was mentioned. It was also mentioned by the Greek astronomer-geographer Ptolemy, the Roman author and philosopher Pliny, and the Chinese monk travellers Fa-hien, Hsuan-tsang, and Yi Jing.  The Kurma-vibhaga segment of the Atharva-veda Parisista incorporates the primal testimony to Tamralipta in Indian literary sources. The Mahabharata distinguishes this ancient city from Suhma, but a later work, Dashakumaracharita, adds \"Damalipta\" within the Suhma Kingdom. It is said that Tamralipta was the capital of Suhma. In the Raghuvamsha, it is described as being located on the bank of the river Kapisa. The Kathsaritsagara observes Tamralipta as an important maritime port and trading center. Some Pali literature identifies it as \"Tamalitti\" or \"Tamalitthi\" and describes it as a port. Tamralipti is mentioned numerous times in the Arthasastra as an imperative center of maritime exchange. The Brihat-Samhita distinguishes \"Tamraliptika\" from \"Gaudaka\" and mentions the sailing of ships from Yavana to the port of \"Damalipta\". Ptolemy mentions \"Tāmralipta\" as a significant town and royal residence. Pliny denotes Tamralipti as 'Taluctae'. The earliest meticulous description of Tamralipta appears in Buddhist literature. In the early fifth century CE, the Chinese Buddhist monk Fa-Hien reported seeing twenty Buddhist monasteries in Tamralipta. Fa-Hien traces Tamralipta, as situated on the seaboard. Whereas Hiuen-Tsang describes that Tamralipta was situated on a creek relatively away from the main Bay of Bengal. According to Hiuen-Tsang, this port town spanned approximately 250 miles and served as the point of convergence of the land and sea trade routes. According to him, the main exports from Tamralipta port were indigo, silk, and copper. In , the Chinese Buddhist monk YiJing reached the east coast of India. He spent five months in Tamralipti and learned Sanskrit. Yijing travelled up the Ganga from Tamralipti to the Buddhist monastery complex of Nalanda, which was the home of thirty-five hundred monks at that time. According to Mahavamsa, an epic history of Sri Lanka, it was the exit point for Ruler Vijaya's voyage to conquer Sri Lanka and the Buddhist mission propelled to Sri Lanka by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Tamralipta is mentioned in Dipavamsa as well. The Vanga is referred to as possessing the city of Tamralipta in one of the Jaina Upangas called Prajñāpanā. According to the Jaina texts, Tamralipta was the capital of the kingdom of Vanga. Tamralipta is mentioned as one of the Jaina ascetic orders in the Jaina Kalpasūtra.\n\nParagraph 3: The start of the 2006 flat season saw George Washington confirm his juvenile promise by easily winning the 2,000 Guineas on Newmarket's Rowley Mile to give O'Brien his fourth win in the race. While George Washington disappointed in the Irish equivalent, he redeemed himself in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Dylan Thomas also made his mark in the top middle distance races in Europe. After going close in the Epsom Derby, he was found to be more effective under a patient Kieren Fallon ride in the Irish Derby. Dylan Thomas also showed his battling qualities in the Irish Champion Stakes, where he beat the Champion mare Ouija Board by a neck. Other 2006 highlights came through Alexandrova who dominated the middle distance fillies classics taking in The Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. The end of season saw the juvenile Holy Roman Emperor take the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère on Arc day at Longchamp. In one of the races of the season he was beaten by a head in the Dewhurst Stakes by European Champion 2-year-old Teofilo. Much anticipation centred on the expected rematch of these two colts in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket the following spring. Aidan finished the season with prizemoney of over €6.5m in Ireland and Great Britain. The season was marked however by the emerging race fixing allegations involving stable jockey Kieren Fallon. On 3 July 2006, Fallon was charged along with 7 other people for conspiring to defraud clients of the internet betting exchange Betfair. Fallon was one of 28 people answering bail at Bishopsgate police station in the City of London in connection with the inquiry. In a released police statement, he was described as being charged with \"offences relating to allegations of fixing the outcome of horse races between 1 December 2002 and 2 September 2004, and money laundering\". He was among three jockeys charged, along with Darren Williams and Fergal Lynch, all of whom had their licences to ride in Britain suspended, effectively under the principle that they would be guilty until found innocent. Fallon's problems were further compounded when on 29 November 2006 the French racing authority France Galop suspended Fallon for six months after he tested positive for a metabolite of a banned substance.\n\nParagraph 4: Broadway Boogie Woogie is a painting by Piet Mondrian completed in 1943, after he had moved to New York in 1940. Compared to his earlier work, the canvas is divided into many more squares. Although he spent most of his career creating abstract work, this painting is inspired by clear real-world examples: the city grid of Manhattan, and boogie-woogie, an African-American Blues music Mondrian loved. The painting was bought by the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins for the price of $800 at the Valentine Gallery in New York City, after Martins and Mondrian both exhibited there in 1943. Martins later donated the painting to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nParagraph 5: James Baker swore under oath that he had received the briefing book from William Casey, Reagan's campaign manager, but Casey, then campaign manager, later CIA director, vehemently denied this. David Stockman, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, admitted using the Carter material while helping Reagan prepare for the debate.  Stockman said the documents obtained were just position papers, not in question-and-answer format. Frank Hodsoll, also a member of the debate team, said that they were in Q&A form. The investigation turned up hundreds of pages of documents from the Carter campaign in Stockman's files as well as in Reagan's campaign archives at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. One document, an itinerary for Carter during the week prior to Election Day, had \"report from White House mole\" written on it.  This seemed to confirm author Laurence Barrett's conclusion in his book that the material had been stolen.  But U.S. News & World Report indicated that the document in question had been volunteered by someone working for Carter. Other papers were turned in to The Washington Post by a collector of political memorabilia who, in October 1980, had exhumed them from a dumpster behind Reagan headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. The press speculated that the Reagan campaign had been concerned that Carter would pull an October surprise during the campaign—cutting a deal with the Ayatollah Khomeini for the release of the 52 hostages held for over a year by Iran, a bombshell that some believed might have sent Carter back to the White House for four more years. Newsweek wondered whether a clandestine operation involving ex-CIA agents had been undertaken by the Reagan team to keep close tabs on the Carter campaign. This was supported by Time in its July 25, 1983, issue. According to that report, William Casey brought in former agents of both the CIA and the FBI to gather information from colleagues who were still with that agency. Jimmy Carter complained that the pilfered documents revealed the \"essence\" of his campaign, implying that his reelection bid had been done great harm when they fell into Republican hands.\n\nParagraph 6: Eusebio Francisco Kino, SJ (, ; 10 August 1645 – 15 March 1711), often referred to as Father Kino, was a Tyrolean Jesuit, missionary, geographer, explorer, cartographer and astronomer born in the Territory of the Bishopric of Trent, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. For the last 24 years of his life he worked in the region then known as the Pimería Alta, modern-day Sonora in Mexico and southern Arizona in the United States. He explored the region and worked with the indigenous Native American population, including primarily the Tohono O'Odham, Sobaipuri and other Upper Piman groups. He proved that the Baja California Territory was not an island but a peninsula by leading an overland expedition there.  By the time of his death he had established 24 missions and visitas (country chapels or visiting stations).\n\nParagraph 7: However, the situation was transformed by the arrival in Munster of the Ulster forces of Hugh O'Neill, who was leading a nationwide rebellion – the Nine Years' War – against the English government in Ireland. In the autumn, Donal Mac Carthaig (the late Earl's illegitimate son) was reported to have acknowledged the authority of the rebel O'Neill and assumed the title of Mac Carthaig Mór, but the O'Sullivan Mór withheld the White Wand or rod of inauguration (which symbolically approved the accession) in favour of Fínghin mac Donncha Mac Carthaig. In a desperate situation, when it seemed that all the native lords in Munster were going into rebellion, the crown granted Mac Carthaig a free pardon, on terms that he immediately withdraw his followers from rebellion in return for qualified acknowledgement of his title against Donal Mac Carthaig, but he prevaricated and only returned to Munster after Sir Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex – whose favour he had been relying upon – threw up his command as lord lieutenant in Ireland in late 1599 and returned to England under a cloud. Mac Carthaig had managed to negotiate English support for his claims to land and title, but he also maintained contact with the rebels to the same end. This has made some commentators claim that his real sympathy lay with the rebels, especially as he was described in his youth as being \"very zealous in the old religion [Catholicism]\". However, it is more likely Fínghin mac Donncha was using both sides as a lever to further his own aims.\n\nParagraph 8: The work is considered too subjective and fanciful, the great fault of the author being that he lacks the impartiality of objective historical insight. Yet, as Pfleiderer says, the work \"is full of a passionate enthusiasm for the character of Jesus.\" The author rejects all the miracles except those of healing, and these he explains psychologically. His main purpose was to modernize and reinterpret Christianity; he says in the preface to the third edition of the book: \"I have written it solely in the service of evangelical truth, to win to the truth those especially who have been most unhappily alienated from the church and its interests, in a great measure through the fault of a reactionary party, blinded by hierarchical aims.\"\n\nParagraph 9: Less than a month after reporting for duty, Shepherd sailed for France on June 17, 1917, as a member of the 5th Marine Regiment with the first elements of the American Expeditionary Forces (Army and Marine Corps troops), and arrived at  Saint-Nazaire in western France on June 27. The 5th Marines became part of the 4th Marine Brigade, 2nd Division (2nd Infantry Division), when the division was organized on October 26 in France. The 2nd Division was placed under the command of Marine Corps Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen, who had been the 5th Marines commander. The 2nd Division trained with French Army veterans the winter of 1917–18.\n\nParagraph 10: Practices of craft or \"domestic arts\" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was marginalized and undervalued. As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles. The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices. Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was \"a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience.\" Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in Consciousness raising that was key to Second-wave feminism as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives."}

WBLY also aired a top-rated Sunday morning big band program. In 1981, the format changed to classic country and later switched to oldies. The station was eventually \"sold\" to Ron Yontz and moved to a new location, which improved its coverage but was detrimental to the AM station's signal.

Aya Nikola becomes the new Tekfur of İnegöl, while Ertuğrul returns to the tribe. Yavlak Arslan seeks to create his own state and sees Osman as an obstacle. They later join forces against a new threat from the Han of the İlhanlı, who allies with Nikola against the Turks of Anatolia. Bala faces the arrival of Targun, Nikola's spy who later allies with Osman. Osman is elected as the new Bey after his father's death and decides to marry a second wife. A major battle with the Byzantines occurs, resulting in the death of Osman's nephew Bayhoca. Osman tries to find a traitor within the Kayı tribe with the help of Ömer Bey, and they face threats from Kara Şaman Togay. Malhun Hatun is captured and later released by Nikola. Osman captures Nikola's ally Tekfur Aris but Togay kills him, keeping Malhun captive. Togay then delivers an ultimatum to surrender the Tekfur in exchange for Malhun, but Osman plans to trap Nikola instead. However, Togay kills Aris, giving Nikola an excuse to keep Malhun captive. Osman initiates a major battle with the Byzantines, with the support of Malhun Hatun. Dündar is revealed as a traitor and is sentenced to death. Osman eventually wins the war with the Byzantines, and his reception by Sultan Mesud II angers Ömer Bey. Nikola betrays Ömer, and Togay ambushes him, but he is saved by Osman. Osman marries Malhun Hatun to improve relations. Togay attacks the Kayı tribe during their migration, resulting in the death of Bamsi Beyrek. Osman takes revenge by killing Togay. Nikola prepares for a great war and faces Osman in battle, but Osman emerges victorious, earning respect among the other beys in Bithynia.", "According to Stephen Oppenheimer, the gene pool of the British Isles has not been significantly impacted by invasions since Roman times. He suggests that the inhabitants of the British Isles from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping, with similarities to the Basque people. Oppenheimer also proposes that the division between the West and East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion, but rather to two main routes of genetic flow after the Last Glacial Maximum. He claims that Celtic languages split from Indo-European earlier than previously believed and that the English language separated from other Germanic languages before the Roman period. Bryan Sykes has also arrived at similar conclusions. The National Museum of Wales, however, notes that early genetic studies have produced unreliable conclusions based on limited samples and outdated assumptions."], "answers": ["Paragraph 10", "Paragraph 8", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Tatanka was suspended on August 30, reportedly as a preemptive measure for being named in a lawsuit to be filed by a woman stemming from an incident in Anaheim, California, following a WWF event in late 1994. According to sources, the woman was said to have been drugged, sodomized and her head shaved on only one side. Kevin Nash reiterated this story in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries. The woman was having drinks with him and Undertaker the night prior. When the wrestlers were leaving the hotel the following morning, Nash noticed that she was seated in between two police officers. The hallway was smeared in blood. She had half her head shaven as she was crying, reporting the incident to the officers. In the interview, however, Nash presumed the person who did this was Jimmy Del Ray because of similar stories of Del Ray. During representation by Tatanka's attorney the facts showed that Tatanka was not involved in the incident at all and Del Ray was fired from the company; Tatanka's suspension was lifted and he returned with full-pay to the active WWF roster. As Nash noted in his interview, he knew that Tatanka was not involved at all, but he had been around Del Ray that night, which caused Tatanka to also be named and unfairly suspended.\n\nParagraph 2: Love in High Life:  A Story of the 'Upper Ten''' (1849)Wreaths of Friendship:  A Gift for the Young (1849)Alice Melville; or, The Indiscretion (1850)All For the Best; or, The Old Peppermint Man (1850)The Debtor's Daughter; or, Life and Its Changes  (1850)The Divorced Wife (1850)Golden Grains from Life’s Harvest Field (1850)Illustrated Temperance Tales (1850)The Lady at Home; or, Leaves from the Every-Day Book of an American Woman (1850)The Orphan Children:  A Tale of Cruelty and Oppression (1850)Out in the World:  A Novel (1850)Pride and Prudence; or, The Married Sisters (1850)Sketches of Life and Character (1850)True Riches; and Other Tales (1850)The Two Brides (1850)The Young Artist; or, The Dream of Italy (1850)Lessons in Life, for All Who Will Read Them (1851)The Lights and Shadows of Real Life (1851)Off-Hand Sketches (1851)Stories for Young Housekeepers (1851)The Tried and the Tempted (1851)The Two Wives (1851)The Way to Prosper; or, In Union There is Strength, and Other Tales (1851)Woman's Trials (1851)Words For the Wise (1851)Cedardale; or, the Peacemakers:  A Story of Village Life (1852)Heart-Histories and Life Pictures (1852)Married Life: Its Shadows and Sunshine  (1852)Lucy Sanford (1852)Maggy's Baby; and Other Stories (1852)Mary Ellis; or, The Runaway Match (1852)Mary Moreton; or, The Broken Promise (1852)Uncle Ben's New Year's Gift; and Other Stories (1852)Who is Greatest?; and Other Stories (1852)The Wounded Boy; and Other Stories (1852)Before and After the Election; or, The Political Experiences of Mr. Patrick Murphy (1853)Finger Posts on the Way of Life (1853)Home Lights and Shadows (1853)The Home Mission (1853)The Iron Rule; or, Tyranny in the Household (1853)Haven't Time and Don't Be in a Hurry; and Other Stories (1853)Heart Histories and Life Pictures (1853)Home Lights and Shadows (1853)The Home Mission (1853)Leaves from the Book of Human Life (1853)The Lost Children; and Other Stories (1853)The Old Man's Bride; or, The Lesson of the Day (1853)Shadows and Sunbeams (1853)Sparing to Spend; or, The Loftons and Pinkertons (1853)Trials of a Needlewoman (1853)True Riches; or, Wealth Without Wings (1853)The Angel of the Household (1854)Home Scenes and Home Influence: A Series of Tales and Sketches (1854)The Lady at Home; or, Happiness in the Household (1854)Pierre, the Organ Boy (1854)Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There (1854)Trials and Confessions of an American Housekeeper (1854)The Year After Marriage (1854)The Good Time Coming (1855)Steps to Heaven (1855)The Three Eras of a Woman's Life:  The Maiden, the Wife, and the Mother (1855)Trial and Triumph; or, Firmness in the Household (1855)Women's Trials; or, Tales and Sketches from Real Life (1855)The Fireside Angel (1856)The Mother’s Rule; or, The Right Way and the Wrong Way (1856)Our Homes:  Their Cares and Duties, Joys and Sorrows (1856)What Can Woman Do?

He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the Basque people of northern Spain and southwestern France, from 90% in Wales to 66% in East Anglia. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow – one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe – which occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum. He reports work on linguistics by Forster and Toth which suggests that Indo-European languages began to fragment some 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. He claims that the Celtic languages split from the Indo-European earlier than previously suspected, some 6000 years ago. He claims that the English language split from the other Germanic languages before the Roman period, and became the English that was spoken by the Belgae tribes of what is now southern and eastern England, northeastern France, and Belgium prior to their conquest by the Romans, and long before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxon. Bryan Sykes came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer in his research, which he set forth in his 2006 published book Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History, published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland. In its summary of their article \"Who were the Celts?\", the National Museum of Wales note, \"It is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject. However, early studies have, so far, tended to produce implausible conclusions from very small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and archaeology\".\n\nParagraph 4: The A.V. Club gave the Xbox 360 version a B−, saying that it \"practically runs on rails, and at times takes on the rhythms of an old-school duck-and-cover coin-op like Time Crisis\". 411Mania gave the game a score of six out of ten, calling it \"a game that you should rent first before buying. Some will love that it's a lot like a movie and features lots of shootouts; some will hate it for the same reason. Fortunately, if you try it before you buy it, you'll know almost immediately whether or not this is going to be the game for you\".  The Escapist gave the PC version three stars out of five, calling it \"a decent game, with some fun cover mechanics and tactical complexity, but the visual realism kind of shoots itself in the foot with unrealistic situations and tedious level design\".  However, The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version a score of five out of ten, saying, \"as much fun as there is to be had in the multiplayer, it doesn't include any new developments or references to the game's main plot and suffers from the absence of its title characters. The fact that the campaign only takes around five hours to complete further fuels the sense Dog Days is an incomplete and flawed package\". Tae K. Kim of GamePro similarly gave the same console version two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \"I felt like I could have developed some sort of emotional connection with Kane and Lynch if only they had been presented in the right light, but ultimately, the only thing I felt at the end of my time with the game was a vague sense of relief that I didn't have to spend any more time in their company\". Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation heavily panned the game, saying, \"there's nothing fun about the game. No light relief. Just one piece of nauseating unpleasantness after another\". He later deemed it as the worst game of 2010. Angry Joe criticized the removal of Lynch's outbursts (due to the character taking medication), citing it as \"not fun\". He also criticized the game's visual effects, the character models, the stiff animations, the lack of variation, the lack of memorable missions (such as the bank robbery in the first game) the game's short 4-5 hour length and the game's abrupt ending. He gave the game a 3/10 rating and recommended Army Of Two: The 40th Day and Kane & Lynch: Dead Men over Dog Days.\n\nParagraph 5: The records show that the victims of the killings in Bahaghs were Michael Courtney jnr, Eugene Dwyer, Daniel Shea, John Sugrue and William Riordan. All from the Waterville area and were members of a unit in the Kerry No 3 Brigade of the IRA. Maurice Riordan, the father of William Riordan (who was only 18 at the time of his killing) applied to the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee - set up to adjudicate on claims arising from the War of Independence and its aftermath - for compensation for this son's death. Several of the families of the other men killed also applied. As a result the Garda Síochána (then called the Civic Guard) undertook an investigation into the Bahaghs killings and concluded the evidence supported the conclusion the men with unlawfully shot and deliberately killed with a mine, and that the National Army version of event was a cover up.  The records show that on 10 December 1923 the then deputy commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Eamonn Coogan (father of the prominent journalist and historian Tim Pat Coogan), included a letter with the Garda report on the Cahersiveen killings to the Secretary of the Department of Justice (then called the Ministry of Justice). In this letter, deputy Commissioner Coogan states that he has been- \"directed by the commissioner [Eoin O'Duffy] to inform you that the facts stated are true and are as follow:\" [...] William Riordan was an \"irregular and one of a column captured with arms\". He was temporarily imprisoned at the workhouse, Cahirciveen, he was taken from there and \"done to death\" with four other prisoners. The body known as the Visiting Committee under Comdt Delaney arrived at Cahirciveen \"to carry out an inspection\", with Lieut P Kavanagh as second in command. \"In the small hours of the morning of March 12th, Kavanagh took five prisoners (of whom Riordan was one) from the guard at the workhouse, remarking 'Would you like to come for a drive?' \"The guard, believing the prisoners were being transferred to Tralee, handed them over. It transpired that the five prisoners were subsequently shot and their bodies blown up by a mine at Bahaghs, Cahirsiveen. Evidence of these facts can be procured. \"The applicant in the claim, who is the father of William Riordan, is in needy circumstances.\"\n\nParagraph 6: Advocate R. K. Chaudhary (Jeetendra), a disciple of justice, prosecutes Shankar Singh (Shakti Kapoor) for murder case, who is the twin brother of a dangerous gangster Jai Singh (also Shakti Kapoor) and the case is defended by Chaudhary's opponent Kailash (Kader Khan). Chaudhary wins the case and Shankar Singh is sentenced to death. Jai Singh swore to take revenge from Chaudhary when Kailash also joins him and they hang to repay. Chaudhary leads a happy family life with his ideal wife Janki (Moushumi Chatterjee), son Inspector Ramesh (Arun Govil), daughter-in-law Lata, and daughter Laxmi (Debashree Roy), a dumb girl. Parallelly, Ramu (also Jeetendra) a young & energetic guy, resembles Chaudhary, is a motor mechanic & a racer and he loves Kailash's daughter Rekha (Sridevi). Recognizing Ramu's caliber, Jai Singh & Kailash misuse him for their criminal activities which he too accepts to fulfill his life ambition of constructing a house for his mother Radha (Hema Malini), who is under prison for the crime he committed. Meanwhile, Chaudhary becomes High Court Chief Justice which evildoers couldn't abide, so they get Laxmi married to their acolyte Gopal (Raj Kiran) to exploit Chaudhary but he stands strong even Gopal necks out Laxmi. At the same time, Kailash discovers Ramu is Justice Chaudhary's son, so they again incite him by creating Chaudhary as a deceiver of his mother and provokes Ramu against Chaudhary to take revenge. Now Ramu indicts Ramesh in a crime by changing his attire as Chaudhary and in the court, Chaudhary compelled to sentence life imprisonment to him. Thereafter, Chaudhary starts digging the matter when he finds out Radha is alive & Ramu is his son. Then he recalls the past, Chaudhary & Radha were love birds in college and just before their marriage, Radha goes missing. Later he ascertains herself as dead. Hence on the advice of his Diwanji, he reconciles with life and marries Janki. At present, Chaudhary decides to affirm the truth but due to Janki's health condition, he holds back. In the meantime, Radha is released from prison. Chaudhary meets her, learns that she has intentionally left his life being aware of Janki's love when Chaudhary understands her virtue and also divulges Ramu's credulity. At that point of time, evil-minded Jai Singh seizes Chaudhary's family even Kailash also double-crossed by him. Here Chaudhary gamely breaks out his play. Simultaneously, knowing the truth, Ramu realizes his mistake and goes for his father's aid. At last, both of them see the end of Papa Rao when Radha sacrifices her life to save Chaudhary. Finally, the movie ends a happy note with the marriage of Ramu & Rekha.\n\nParagraph 7: Typically, an MFL tool consists of two or more bodies.  One body is the magnetizer with the magnets and sensors and the other bodies contain the electronics and batteries.  The magnetizer body houses the sensors that are located between powerful \"rare-earth\" magnets.  The magnets are mounted between the brushes and tool body to create a magnetic circuit along with the pipe wall.   As the tool travels along the pipe, the sensors detect interruptions in the magnetic circuit.  Interruptions are typically caused by metal loss and which in most cases is corrosion and the dimensions of the potential metal loss is denoted previously as \"feature.\"  Other features may be manufacturing defects and not actual corrosion. The feature indication or \"reading\" includes its length by width by depth as well as the o'clock position of the anomaly/feature.  Mechanical damage such as shovel gouges can also be detected.  The metal loss in a magnetic circuit is analogous to a rock in a stream.  Magnetism needs metal to flow and in the absence of it, the flow of magnetism will go around, over or under to maintain its relative path from one magnet to another, similar to the flow of water around a rock in a stream.  The sensors detect the changes in the magnetic field in the three directions (axial, radial, or circumferential) to characterize the anomaly. The sensors are typically oriented axially which limits data to axial conditions along the length of the pipeline.  Other designs of smart pigs can address other directional data readings or have completely different functions than that of a standard MFL tool. Oftentimes an operator will run a series of inspection tools to help verify or confirm MFL readings and vice versa.  An MFL tool can take sensor readings based on either the distance the tool travels or on increments of time.  The choice depends on many factors such as the length of the run, the speed that the tool intends to travel, and the number of stops or outages that the tool may experience.\n\nParagraph 8: Aya Nikola is sent to become the new Tekfur of İnegöl followed by Ertuğrul's return in the tribe. Meanwhile, Yavlak Arslan, the new Uç Bey, seeks to create his own state and sees Osman as an obstacle, later on they unite against the new threat created by the new Han of the İlhanlı (), who allies with Nikola against the Turks of Anatolia. Bala also faces the arrival of Targun, Nikola's spy who allies with Osman to save her father, İnal Bey. Along with these problems, Osman is elected as the new Bey after his father's death, whilst he decides to marry a second wife according to his father’s will. After Targun's death, Osman meets Malhun Hatun and initiates a major battle with the Byzantines, historically known as the  in which his nephew   Bayhoca, gets martyred by Flatyos which results in Savci Bey and Lena killing Flatyos as well as Osman Bey trying to find the traitor in the Kayı, as his jealous uncle Dündar helps the Byzantines stir traps for him. Following the arrival of Ömer Bey, father of Malhun Hatun, Geyhatu sends Kara Şaman Togay to eliminate both Osman's Kayı and Ömer's Bayındır. Meanwhile, Malhun is sent by her father to İnegöl to ally with Nikola against Togay but she gets captured in the castle by Togay, who has already allied with Nikola. Osman also captures Nikola's ally Tekfur Aris, seeking to ally with him, Togay then delivers an ultimatum to surrender the Tekfur in exchange for Malhun. Osman decides to use the captured tekfur as bait to trap Nikola. However, Togay kills Aris on the way which gives Nikola an excuse to keep Malhun in captivity. Nikola martyrs Zülfikar Derviş, Osman's spy in İnegöl and also releases Malhun to gain the support of Ömer Bey, who seeks to sell him horses in order to infiltrate and conquer the İnegöl castle but the sale of horses angers Osman, who (not knowing their plan) orders them to be seized. Meanwhile, Togay ambushes some of the Kayı on the way back from Boran Alp's unfinished wedding with Gonca Hatun, which results in the martyrdom of Abdurrahman Gazi. Osman later attacks the incoming Kalanoz, who is the younger brother of Kalanoz and was sent after Flatyos’ capture and death, after learning of his arrival indirectly from the Mongols, killing many Byzantine soldiers and Osman also invites all Turkmen tribes to join the attack except the Bayındırlı, angering Ömer Bey. Şeyh Edebali later calls Osman and Ömer Bey to Söğüt to resolve their differences, leading to Ömer Bey handing over Dündar's ring to Osman, exposing Dündar as a traitor. Although Simon, Petrus and Hazal Hatun are exposed and captured first, Osman lures Dündar into a trap then captures him. Dündar then is taken to the tribe and sentenced to death by Osman. Just as he is about to be strangled to death by the alps, he requests to be shot by Osman instead, using the arrow that killed Bayhoca per Savcı's wish and gets eventually executed, whilst Hazal is exiled to the Çobanoğlu tribe. Osman then initiates a major battle with the Byzantines, with the support of Malhun Hatun which is historically known as the  in which Kalanoz martyrs Savci Bey and gets killed by Osman later on. In the battle, Osman had tricked Togay by promising taxes. But when Osman kicks out the messenger sent by Togay, who later kills him, the Mongol Governor, Wali Yargucu, complains to the vassal ruler of Selcuk, Sultan Mesud II, who invites Osman under the pretext of giving him gifts. After an argument, Osman agrees to pay taxes to the Sultan, who promises him future aid. Osman's reception by Mesud II angers Omer  Bey, who decides to make a name for himself. Nikola uses Omer's anger and uses him to attack Togay. However, Nikola betrays Omer and Togay ambushes him. In the meantime, the Mongol forces raid Omer's tribe, which depresses him, causing him to go to Togay for revenge. Gets saved by Osman. In order to improve their relations, Osman marries Omer's daughter, Malhun Hatun. Later, when the Kayis are migrating to Domaniç, Togay attacks them and Bamsi Beyrek gets martyred. Osman later takes revenge by killing Togay in Soğut. In the meantime, Nikola begins preparations for a great war and fights a major battle against Osman, who is aided by Sultan Mesud II. Osman wins, which greatly increases his respect among the other beys in Bithynia.\n\nParagraph 9: Anil Anto and his wife Amala shift from Kottarakara and settle down with the help of his friends in Kochi. They rent a small apartment and slowly settle down to their lives. Anil works for a cable TV company as a technician. \"Gorilla\" Darwin is a well known gangster, who, along with his brothers, rules the Kochi underworld. Meanwhile, Amala is pregnant, and she and her husband are very happy. During a drive by, Darvin's brother steals Amala's chain and pushes her down, causing a miscarriage. Their lives turn due to this incident. They complain to the police, but to no avail. During an installation, Anil sees the person who caused this problem. He chases them and gets into a fight. He brutally beats him up and takes him to the police. The police inspector is a cousin of Darvin and abuses Anil for beating up a culprit. He then calls up Darvin to come to pick up his brother. Darvin picks his brother from the police station and insults Anil by giving some money for Anil to get his wife a new chain. Anil slaps Darvin, which causes a scene. Darvin retreats back. Anil then faces Darvin's wrath. Darvin and the gang slowly steal every belonging from Anil and leave them with just an empty apartment. Anil loses all his possessions. A friendly policeman then explains that this is Darvin's style of reacting and he cannot do anything about it. After all this, Anil takes help from a small-time gangster to try to kidnap Darvin's child and fails spectacularly in a comedic fashion. They decide to kidnap Darvin's younger brother Gilli, who is a film buff. They make a ransom call to Darvin, only to be rebutted. While browsing through the photos on Gilli's phone, Anil finds the photo of a golden statue belonging to the church in their area. He realises that Darvin in the pretext of repairing the church has switched the golden one for a duplicate statue and holds the golden one in his chicken farm. Anil then steals this statue from the farm and starts negotiating with Darvin, knowing that Darvin has a deal fixed to sell this statue to a foreign customer. He asks Darvin to give him his stuff, not new but the exact items were stolen from him. Beginning a cat-and-mouse game, pushing Darvin's patience. The final item is Anil's bike, which was stolen from him and sold to Darvin's rival. Darvin fights with his rival Solomon to get the bike back. However, as Solomon tries to kill Darvin, Anil intervenes and helps Darvin out. Darvin initially plans to finish Anil for good once he tells him the location of the golden statue; however, he has a change of heart after Anil helps him out.\n\nParagraph 10: WULM has had many different formats over the years since it started broadcasting.  Originally country (as WJEL) when it was founded, when it was sold to a group of local businessmen and the call letters were changed to WBLY for the principals - Bailey, Lucas and Yontz.  The station operated at 1600 kHz with 1,000 watts of power from sunrise to sunset.  During winter months, WBLY was authorized to operate at 250 watts from 6:00 AM until sunrise. The format was changed to talk in the morning along with music, with its host Smilin' Bob (Bob Yontz) and was a MOR station (Middle of the Road) the rest of the day.  Smilin Bob remained a personality on the station through the 1970s and into the early 1990s.  He became greatly known all around the valley.  He was famous for giving all of his callers a nickname, and he handed out many.  WBLY also aired a Sunday morning big band program hosted by Roger Sharp that was the top rated program in its time slot for the Dayton area.  Upon Sharp's death in 1989, the Sunday morning program was hosted by Tom Eipper (airname Tom James).  In 1981 WBLY changed its format to classic country and switching to oldies in 1987 and the following year it was \"sold\" to Yontz's son Ron, who operated RAY broadcasting.  In 1988 WBLY moved its tower from its former AM-friendly location off West First Street to a more FM-friendly location on Miller Road.  The tower move increased WAZU's coverage in the Dayton area, but was detrimental to the AM station.  Also in 1988 WBLY (which was a \"daytime\" station) received authorization to operate 24 hours per day. The authorized power from sunset to sunrise was 30 watts.  To celebrate, and in keeping with the format, staff members Dale Grimm and Jim Mosier were on the air for 24 continuous hours, operating from the station's \"street studio\" on the first floor of the Marketplace on South Fountain Avenue."}
{"queries": ["The text describes the history of the Pandya Kingdom of Tamilakam and its subsequent migration to Kerala. The Pandya Kingdom was attacked by Malik Kafur, the commander-in-chief of Alauddin Khalji, prompting two branches of the dynasty to flee to the west of Kerala to protect themselves. One branch settled in Poonjar, while the other branch faced many difficulties before settling in Pandalam. The Chembazhannur branch initially settled in Valliyur and later Tenkasi but faced threats of invasion, leading them to move to Puliyankudi. They eventually settled in Konni, constructing a shrine for Lord Shiva and establishing themselves as the ruling class. Due to attacks by the Cholas, they moved to Pandalam, where they established a full-fledged kingdom. The Pandalam rulers maintained friendly relations with the rajas of Travancore, particularly through their close friendship with Kunjunni Varma Thampan.", "This text provides a brief summary of the life and career of Lloyd-Jones. He was born in Cardiff, Wales in 1899 and grew up in Llangeitho. His father was a grocer and he had two brothers. One brother died during the flu pandemic in 1918, while the other became a High Court judge. Lloyd-Jones attended a London grammar school and then studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He worked as an assistant to the Royal Physician and obtained a medical degree from the University of London. After feeling a calling to preach, he returned to Wales in 1927 and married Bethan Phillips. He accepted an invitation to minister at a church in Aberavon, Port Talbot. They had two children together.", "In the year 1800, a group of Agsalog (Igorot) people in Golot, Mountain Province decided to leave their impoverished and troubled homeland. They held a secret meeting and divided themselves into three groups, with each group heading in a different direction. Before beginning their journey, they performed religious rites and offered sacrifices to appease the gods. The group that traveled to the west eventually arrived at a place called Lidlidda. Along the way, they faced challenges such as difficult terrain and hunger. After twenty days, they found a suitable location to settle, with abundant resources such as fish, wild animals, and fruit. They believed that this place would allow them to establish a peaceful and prosperous community, prompting them to stop their nomadic lifestyle and settle there."], "answers": ["Paragraph 9", "Paragraph 4", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Although London admits that she doesn't \"do things for other people\", she has often attempted to do many generous things, with unfortunate results. In \"Mom and Dad On Deck\", she hoped to find Moseby the perfect gift for his birthday but resulted in her annoyingly following him everywhere in order to find out what he likes. She even tried to nurse Moseby after he got injured slipping on the sky deck, but only ends up making him feel crowded. In the same episode, it is revealed that it takes her half-an-hour to read one page in even the simplest books (she reads 'The Pokey Little Princess' to Moseby, and her problem is revealed). In the season two episode \"Smarticle Particles\", Bailey tricks London into doing well in school by giving her a \"smart perfume\" (as a placebo), to which London responds to as planned. However, London finds out later that the perfume is fake, and is upset that her 'smarticles' weren't real, and she states while crying that she can't be smart now, and that she likes \"being smart\" Bailey then cheers her up with a \"smart lipstick\", which London happily uses. This shows that London is actually very bright but lacks enough confidence to believe so. But other instances conclude that she doesn't know very much at all (e.g., in \"Marriage 101\", when she's mentioned the number of her father's marriages she holds up six fingers, though clearly saying \"eight\"). In \"Family Thais\", the gang travels to Thailand, where London meets her grandmother, and at first is upset, and disgusted after finding out that she was a farmer. In \"Lost at Sea\", London pretends to go insane and that she's on an island resort in order not to have to do any work. After they finally escape the island in a balloon made out of her clothes and fly back to the SS Tipton, she reveals her deception and makes Cody and Bailey acknowledge she's a lot smarter than they give her credit for. She is also seen to be precise with her hands, such as when she repaired a small boat with various eyebrow care products in \"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\".\n\nParagraph 2: With a regiment in September 1904, he marched from Liaoyang to Fynhuangcheng and on to Yala. On April 11, Lechitsky was entrusted with protecting a section of the Yalu River from the village of Syndyagou to s.

Some groups of these people were hospitable, while some were fierce fighters, head hunters, animal rustlers, robbers and the like which worsened the already impoverished state of their place. Tired of such constant inconveniences, the hospitable and peaceful people plotted to leave after holding a secret meeting. They grouped themselves into three: one group to head for the North, another to the South and the third to the West. Being Igorots with customs and traditions firmly instilled by their ancestors, they observed their usual religious rites before starting the journey. A number of chickens were killed and offered to Kabunian (God) and his son Lumawig.  It is a peace offering meant to appease the gods in order not to anger them.  After the ceremony, a safe and peaceful passage to a wonderful land destined especially for them, is expected. The night after the ceremony was held, the peaceful people started their journey.  They moved silently under cover of the tall, thick trees eastward and the shining stars up above served as their guide. The group that traveled to the west were the ones who reached the place, which would be known in the future as Lidlidda. Members of this group had such names as Conay, Caoas, Digay, Caoeng, San-E, Gumanab, Anggon, Calugay and others. Along the way, they met obstacles and hardships associated with the mountainous terrain and the constant feeling of hunger and tiredness. After twenty days of hiking, they arrived in a place that looked suitable for building homes. It was a valley with grassy plains, a river along its sides, creeks, brooks, and wells. There were plenty of fish, wild animals and game for food. The surrounding hills and mountains abundantly covered with tall trees and bamboo could provide them with shade and fruit. The immediate belief that soon a peaceful, progressive and happy community would be positively established in the said place compelled the travelers to stop their seemingly nomadic existence and settle on the area.\n\nParagraph 4: Lloyd-Jones was born in Cardiff on 20 December 1899 and raised in Llangeitho, Cardiganshire. His father was a grocer, and he had two brothers: Harold died during the 1918 flu pandemic, while Vincent went on to become a High Court judge.  Llangeitho is associated with the Welsh Methodist revival, as it was the location of Daniel Rowland's ministry. Attending a London grammar school between 1914 and 1917 and then St Bartholomew's Hospital as a medical student, in 1921 he started work as assistant to the Royal Physician, Sir Thomas Horder. Lloyd-Jones obtained a medical degree from the University of London, and became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians.  After struggling for two years over what he sensed was a calling to preach, in 1927 Lloyd-Jones returned to Wales, having married Bethan Phillips (with whom he later had two children, Elizabeth and Ann), accepting an invitation to minister at a church in Aberavon (Port Talbot).\n\nParagraph 5: The cadets are, from 2014 onward, grouped into three battalions, the Mounted and the two Infantry battalions. The companies that form the now two Infantry Battalions are A and B (Academy) and F, G, H, and I (College) while the Mounted Battalion consists of \"D\" Troop, \"E\" Battery, and C Company joined in 2018, VFMAC Field Music (formerly also the Drum and Bugle Corps), and the VFMAC Regimental Band. Once, most College Cadets in the infantry battalion were assigned to the \"F\" Company, but have been divided into \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" Companies today. \"I\" Company had been named \"I\" Troop for all college cadets wishing to participate in equitation. It was once known as \"I\" Battery for college cadets participating in artillery, but it has now been moved to the collegiate infantry battalion as I Company. Presently, Cadets of the Sixth, Fifth, and Fourth Classes (Grades 7, 8, and 9) are assigned to the \"C\" Company; formerly, Cadets of the Middle School (Grades 7 and 8) were assigned to the \"E\" Battery. During the years of highest enrollment, in the 1960s and 1970s, Cadets of the Middle School were assigned to the \"H\" Company. During the 2009–2010 academic year, given rapid expansion in enrollment, College Cadets have since transferred to the \"H\" Company. F Company, which formerly had the college cadets, was reformed in 2014 as part of the academy.\n\nParagraph 6: By the late 1980s Vess had found a niche in the world of fantasy comic art with publications such as The Raven Banner: A Tale of Asgard written by Alan Zelenetz and published by Marvel Comics in 1985, The Book of Night, published by Dark Horse Comics in 1987, and \"The Warriors Three Saga\" in Marvel Fanfare #34–37 (Sept. 1987–April 1988). He painted the cover of the debut issue of Web of Spider-Man (April 1985), wrote and drew a backup story in The Amazing Spider-Man #277 (June 1986), and crafted the Spider-Man: Spirits of the Earth graphic novel (1990). In 1991 he illustrated the official comic-book adaptation of Steven Spielberg’s Hook and had an eleven issue run (#129–139) as cover artist of Swamp Thing by DC Comics in 1993.\n\nParagraph 7: The opening track, \"Canned Heat\", has \"svelte Chic Organisation strings, a percolating bassline and a stomping four-on-the-floor rhythm\". The second track, \"Planet Home\", is a \"straight, bass-driven funk\" track that has techno influences from \"ghostly ambient harmonies to bone-shaking synth bass,\" and an \"out-of-nowhere Latin hustle breakdown\". The next track, \"Black Capricorn Day\", has a \"driving funk groove with sassy horn interjections\" which tend to \"stutte[r] like a record on a turntable\", with its lyrics about being depressed.  \"Falling\" is a \"bass driven\" acid-jazz ballad track, which is followed by \"Destitute Illusion\", an instrumental track \"swamped in layer upon layer of antique analogue synthesizers\", and has the \"scratching of DJ D-Zire\".\n\nParagraph 8: The SWV vz Xscape Verzuz took place in Atlanta, Georgia, the ladies all coordinated their fashion wear colored in all styles Black. Guest Appearances was made by Jermaine Dupri who lead \"Just Kickin' It\" and Da Brat, who also performed along with Xscape for the remix of Mariah Carey's \"Always Be My Baby\" (Mr. Dupri Mix), Kandi Burruss showcased the song she wrote for Destiny's Child, \"Bills, Bills, Bills\". A new added element to the Verzuz show introduced the Doritos Fan Choice Moment, where the song \"Right Here\" was chosen from the fans. The highlights from the first half were the songs of the last round of the segment, when Xscape performed \"Tonight\", as Tiny gave a rousing performance during her verse and when SWV performed their rendition to Patti LaBelle's song \"If Only You Knew\", as Coko gave her all towards the end despite going through an anxiety attack that emotionally affected her because of a tragedy she witnessed during the early hours of the day, which she later confirmed on social media. The highlights of the second half was Xscape performance of \"Do You Want To\" which was cut off early from DJ AOne but was encored by the audience to perform a redo. Followed by SWV's performance of \"Rain\". Selected solo features were also performed, Tiny & Kandi reflected and performed on their hit song they wrote for TLC \"No Scrubs\", which also mashed up with \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran, which Kandi also acquired rights to for the sample used. Kandi also sang her verse that was featured on E-40's track \"U and Dat\", while Coko performed her featured vocals from \"Men In Black\". She also shared a moment on stage with her older son to sing her solo hit song \"Sunshine\". SWV also performed their iconic hit \"Anything\" as Xscape performed \"Who Can I Run To\", which they shared the stage with Coko to sing part of the verse after she went viral for covering their verse before the battle. Other songs performed were: \"Can We\", \"The Arms of the One Who Loves You\", \"Downtown\", \"Everything I Love\", \"You're the One\" (D.J. Clark Kent Remix and original track), \"I'm So into You\", \"My Little Secret\", \"Ain't No Man\", \"Use Your Heart\", \"Love On My Mind\", \"Always on my Mind\". The celebration ended with SWV performing their song \"Weak\" with an acoustic introduction, while Xscape closed out with \"Understanding\".\n\nParagraph 9: The Pandya Kingdom of Tamilakam was once attacked by Malik Kafur, the commander-in-chief of Alauddin Khalji of Khalji dynasty. Upon the failure of Pandiya rajas, two branches of this dynasty fled towards west (Kerala) to secure themselves from the attacks. One branch proceeded via the Western Ghats mountainous regions and settled in Poonjar in Kottayam and established the Poonjar kingdom. The other branch (Chembazhannur) wandered through several places ghatsand facing much difficulty finally settled in Pandalam. The fleeing Chembazhannur branch at first settled in Valliyur (near Tirunelveli) and enjoyed a privileged position in the society. Later due to the threats of invasion, the royal family shifted to Tenkasi. Thirumalai Savuri Nayunu Ayyalugaru Naidu, a famed ruler of Madurai wished to see his daughter's marriage with a prince of Chembazhannur family. But upon the rejection of marriage proposal, Nayak became an enemy of Pandiyas. He made huge damages in Tenkasi with his strong Maravappada (army). Knowing that they couldn't continue a peaceful life in Tenkasi, the family moved to a place named  and procured the mountainous regions near Puliyankudi. But Nayak continued to torture the royal family which forced them to proceed towards west (Kerala) via places such as Achankovil, Aryankavu, Kulathupuzha and settled in Konni by c. 79 ME, which was according to the Copper deed issued by the Venad raja. The family constructed a shrine for lord Shiva in Konni (Muringamangalam Sreemahadevar Temple) for their daily worships. This temple is one of the most noted contributions of Chembazhanuur family in Kerala. A number of Mutts, Manas and Koyikkalls were also constructed by the family. The local people fed up with the activities of thieves accepted the family as the ruling class which was named as Chembazhanji kovilakom. Attacks on Travancore by Cholas forced the family to flee Konni and then to settle down in Pandalam which became their permanent capital. A full-fledged kingdom was established by around  ME (1194 CE) by obtaining the land from Kunjunni Varma Thampan (Kaipuzha Thampan) of Amanthur Kovilakam at Kaipuzha and the local ruler and landlord of the region. The Venad ruler also played a great role in the establishment of this kingdom. People enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere and ideal life under the Pandalam rulers. As of the Travancore state manual, Pandalam kingdom kept friendly relations with the rajas of Travancore. Relation between Kaipuzha Thampan and Maharaja of Travancore was extremely cordial. Pandhalam Raja established a good relation with Maharaj of Travancore through Kunjunni Varma Thampan who was the close friend, advisory of Maharaja of Travancore.\n\nParagraph 10: Chassis of this model of Brazilian origin were built by the companies Caio, Ciferal and Thamco to be sent to Montevideo, Uruguay both before and after the launch of the \"National Renewal Plan\" of the fleet for the companies CUTCSA, COETC, UCOT and Raincoop, CUTCSA acquiring some 260 (10 in 1990, 18 in 1991 before the \"National Plan for Fleet Renewal\" that were built by CUTCSA itself in Uruguay, 175 after its launch in 1993 and 57 in 1994) cars with CAIO Vitória bodywork that would be radiated between 2008 (one of these cassis had its Engine removed and used in a Brill Model 60 motorcar as a replacemebt for the Cummins Diesel Engine used in the 1960s as a replacement of its original Gasoline Engine it had) and 2015 when the ex-UCOT units acquired in 2002, COETC that acquired a total of 153 cars with Ciferal Padron Rio bodywork(two batches of 14 and 38 cars in 1992, 83 in 1993, 6 in 1994 and 5 in 1996) that have been serviced between 2008 and 2022, UCOT acquired 118 chassis with CAIO Vitória bodies (in a total renewal of the fleet) that They were disaffected and referred to multiple destinations between In 2001(these cars would all be sold to CUTCSA or Raincoop) and 2012, keeping some as substitutes, Raincoop acquired 91 cars with CAIO Vitória bodies (15 for suburban use between 1992 and 1993, 15 urban in 1992, 55 urban in 1993 and 6 urban ones in 1994) these were maintained until 2011 where they were radiated from service in a renovation completed in 2012 with some ex-UCOT acquired in 2002 Remaining in the company until its closure in 2016, in 1993 some 18 B58E chassis were built for Raincoop by Thamco in the Scorpion TH3250USS model that would be discontinued between 2008 and the cooperative's closure in 2016 With car 100 passing into the hands of Erhitran (association dedicated to the conservation of the heritage of the Uruguayan bus), Raincoop acquired a last chassis of this model in 1998 for its suburban lines that was bodied with Marcopolo Allegro GV; Two companies from the interior of Uruguay acquired a chassis of this model for urban and suburban use, these being Olivera Hnos. from Maldonado, who bought 10 units for bodywork woth CAIO Vitória bodywork that would pass into the hands of CODESA in their merger. while in the city of Las Piedras of the Canelones Department the company CODET acquired 11 with CAIO Vitória \"Intercity\" bodywork in 1992 and another 10 in 1993 with two addition acquisitions done of second-hand vehicles from Solfy SA, being 2 Marcopolo Allegro G4 in 1997 and 4 Marcopolo Allegro GV in 1998 with all of them becoming the property of COETC on August 1, 2007, with the merger between both companies being deactivated between 2008 and 2011; the interdepartmental company CITA S.A also had cars with Volvo B58E chassis with the last one ceasing its services in 2018"}
{"queries": ["According to Robert Vane Russell, many gotras (clans) in the Hindu religion have names that originate from plants, animals, and natural objects. These totemic names are common among tribes but also exist in Hindu castes. The most common totem names are animals, including those that are considered sacred by Hindus. There is a wide variety of names, including trees, crops, salt, and household objects. The names of certain rishis (sages) are also associated with animals and plants. The characteristic of totemism is that members of a clan see themselves as related to the animals or trees from which the clan gets its name and refrain from killing or eating them.", "Bell miners are a type of bird that mainly feed on insects called psyllids and their secretions. Psyllid products make up a large part of the bell miner's diet, sometimes comprising up to 90% of it. They primarily forage in the canopy, but also descend to the understory. There is a theory that bell miners \"farm\" psyllids by excluding other psyllid-eating bird species from their territory. This theory suggests that bell miners may selectively eat older nymphs or lerps, leaving the nymphs unharmed. The evidence for this theory has been mixed, with some studies supporting it and others not. However, when bell miners are removed from an area, other bird species quickly consume the psyllid colonies that were previously protected by the miners.", "In his review of Greyhawk Adventures for Dragon magazine, Jim Bambra notes that the book is a collection of independent sections with little crossover. He mentions that the writing style reflects the numerous contributors, with some sections being lively and evocative while others are more dry and rules-focused. Bambra explains that while the book is aimed at World of Greyhawk fans, players of campaigns set in different worlds can still find interest in the new spells, magical items, and monsters. The descriptions of NPCs, deities, and clerics can also be used as templates for similar characters in other campaigns, and the adventures and section on zero-level characters are applicable to any campaign. Bambra suggests that some content may be less appealing to non-Greyhawk players, but it still provides inspiration. He praises the section on avatars but believes it could have been improved by including motivations for deities sending avatars. Bambra finds the information on playing clerics accessible but wishes there was more guidance on their conduct and associated myths. He compliments the section on monsters for its layout and presentation. Overall, Bambra states that Greyhawk Adventures tries to cater to a wide audience, but he feels it spreads itself too thin and adds little to the background of Oerth, the World of Greyhawk setting. However, he acknowledges that the book contains good material and is a useful purchase for those seeking new spells, items, and adventure inspiration."], "answers": ["Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 3"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Algiers is a 1938 American drama film directed by John Cromwell and starring Charles Boyer, Sigrid Gurie, and Hedy Lamarr. Written by John Howard Lawson, the film is about a notorious French jewel thief hiding in the labyrinthine native quarter of Algiers known as the Casbah. Feeling imprisoned by his self-imposed exile, he is drawn out of hiding by a beautiful French tourist who reminds him of happier times in Paris. The Walter Wanger production was a remake of the successful 1937 French film Pépé le Moko, which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name.\n\nParagraph 2: According to Robert Vane Russell, many gotras of Hindu religion are of totemic origin which is named after plants, animals, and natural objects. These are universal among tribes but occur also in Hindu castes. The commonest totem names are those of animals, including several which are held sacred by Hindus, as bagh or Nahar, the tiger; bachhas, the calf; murkuria, the peacock; kachhua, the tortoise; nagas, the cobra; hathi, the elephant; bhains, the buffalo; richaria, the bear; Kuliha, the Jackal, Kukura, the dog; kursaal, the deer; Hiran, the black-buck and so on. The utmost variety of names is found, and numerous trees, as well as rice and other crops, salt, sandalwood, cucumber, pepper, and some household implements such as pestle, rolling slab, serve as the names of clans. Thus the name of the rishi Bharadvaja means a lark bird, and Kaushika means descended from Kusha grass, Agastya from Agassi flower, Kashyapa from kachhap a tortoise, Taittiri from titer, partridge bird. Similarly, the origin of other rishis is attributed to animals, Rishyasringa to an antelope, Mandavya to a frog, Kanada to an owl. The usual characteristic of totemism is that the members of a clan regard themselves as related to or descended from, the animals or trees from which the clan takes its name, and abstain from killing or eating them.\n\nParagraph 3: Jim Bambra reviewed Greyhawk Adventures for Dragon magazine No. 143 (March 1989). Bambra commented on the book: \"As a sourcebook which further elaborates on an existing world, Greyhawk Adventures is a collection of independent sections with little in the way of crossover between each one. The writing style reflects the large number of contributors involved, with the tone varying from lively and evocative to dry and rules-orientated, with the emphasis on mechanics.\" He noted that while the book was primarily aimed at World of Greyhawk fans, players of campaigns set in other worlds would find much to interest them, such as new spells, magical items, and monsters; also, the descriptions of NPCs and of Greyhawk's deities and clerics can act as templates for similar deities and characters in other campaigns, and the adventures and the section on zero-level characters could also be used in any campaign. Bambra felt that some of the content would be less likely to be of interest to non-Greyhawk campaign players, but that it can still serve as a source of inspiration: \"Greyhawk Adventures has something in it for everyone, but its wide diversity of topics tends to dilute its overall impact and usefulness.\" He found the section on avatars useful, but felt that \"it would have benefited by describing the things that avatars do and providing motivations for why a particular deity would send an avatar to Oerth in the first place\". Bambra felt that most of the information on how to play clerics was readily accessible, but that the rules on spheres would only come to light once the AD&D 2nd Edition game was published. He felt that while the book defined clerics well in game terms, it could have included more information on how clerics should conduct themselves in the pursuit of their deities' aims and more information detailing the myths and legends associated with the deities. He considered the \"Monsters of Greyhawk\" section neatly laid out with all the essential information presented in a tabulated form, an insight into how the AD&D 2nd Edition game would likely be presented, and he considered the new monsters \"useful\". Bambra concludes the review with an overall evaluation of the book: \"Greyhawk Adventures attempts to be many things to many people. Assuming this is its aim, it succeeds admirably, for everyone who looks at it will find something of interest. However, considered as a whole, it is less successful. Even hardened fans of the World of Greyhawk fantasy setting may be disappointed as Greyhawk Adventures adds little to the background of Oerth, instead providing useful add-ons and enhancements. [...] Don’t get me wrong—Greyhawk Adventures includes some very good material, and it's a useful purchase for those of you looking for new spells, magical items, ways to make clerics more interesting, and for inspiration in the adventure department. It's just that I cannot shake the feeling that Greyhawk Adventures has spread itself too thin.\"\n\nParagraph 4: The idea for the plants in \"Zero Hour\" came from Brad Wright, who in season four had the notion of the SG being overrun with plant life and the gate being literally buried under foliage. For \"Icon\", one of the locations used was a house built in the early 1900s. Like \"Birthright\" one year before, exterior scenes for \"Sacrifices\" were filmed at High Point Properties in Langley, British Columbia. The Goa'uld ceremonial tent in the episode was designed to be re-usable, with the concept loosely based on the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. \"Reckoning\", in which Carter attempts to open the Ancient Wall, was filmed at a sound stage at NorCo Studios, a former bicycle factory. The ventilation is questionable, and when the director decided to add smoke for the light to catch to give a dramatic dusty air feeling, the oxygen supply decreased, which made acting harder. Daniel's class room in \"Moebius\" were shot in the conference room of the Outer Limits production at Bridge Studios near the set of SG-1. SG-1 crew members had originally scouted a real school but lost that location. Carter's office room in the same episode was right down the hall from the conference room.Stargate SG-1 was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As Vancouver is still developing, Tynehead Park is one of the few locations where the SG-1 team can still film alien locations. Other Vancouver locations include a set of roads at a Vancouver airport for the episode \"Full Alert\". The roads were closed to regular traffic so that the filming could take place without police escorts and other difficulties that come from blocking traffic. Desert locations were shot at the Richmond Sand Dunes, a cement factory that is slowly using up all the sand. What is seen in the \"Moebius\" desert is all that is left of the dune. The horse shoe form of the dune had been established by another television project called Legend of Earthsea. O'Neill's house, which was first seen in season one, was used in two episodes in season eight, \"Full Alert\" and \"Citizen Joe\". Since the house is inhabited in real life, the producers have looked for alternatives, but so far have been unsuccessful. For \"Zero Hour\", the SGC set was decorated with various plants and vines. Some plants were plastic, but for the torching scenes, real plants were used so as to minimize the risk of a fire. All objects on set were sprayed with flame-retardant chemicals.TV Zone Special issue #S58, page 26-27.\n\nParagraph 5: The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives. Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels – The Falcon Cuts In, 1937, and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938 – and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen's short story \"Gay Falcon\" (aka \"A Man Called Falcon\"), which was originally published in 1940 in Town & Country magazine. The story opens with the words \"Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them.\" Arlen's Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter – a man who makes his living \"keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.\"\n\nParagraph 6: Bell miners specialize in consuming insects known as psyllids and their associated young nymphs, sweet lerps, and other psyllid secretions. Psyllid products may consist of up to 90% of the bell miner's diet. Bell miners forage primarily among leaves, branches, and loose bark in the canopy, generally at least 8 m in height, but they do descend to the dense understory. There is a theory that bell miners 'farm' psyllids by excluding other psyllid-eating bird species from a large enough territory, that the miners themselves do not require all the psyllids from in order to sustain the colony. One hypothesis under the farming theory is that the bell miners may selectively eat only older nymphs, or may often eat the lerps and leave the nymph unharmed. Evidence for this theory has been mixed. An early study of stomach contents did not find supporting evidence for this theory, as bell miner stomachs did not contain the higher lerp/nymph ratio that would have been expected. However, a later behavioral comparison between bell miners and noisy miners did observe that bell miners carefully used their tongue to remove lerps, which left the nymph intact. In contrast, noisy miners pried the lerp and nymph off with their beak and consumed both. When bell miners are removed, psyllid colonies are generally quickly decimated by the other forest bird species that move into the miners' former territory.\n\nParagraph 7: CSI originally starred William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger alongside an ensemble including George Eads, Gary Dourdan, and Paul Guilfoyle. Jorja Fox joined the cast in episode two of the first season, whilst Eric Szmanda and Robert David Hall recurred throughout the first two seasons of the show before being promoted to regular status starting with the third. Louise Lombard, who first appeared in season five, joined the cast starting with season seven. The first major cast overhaul came with the show's eighth and ninth seasons. Lombard departed the cast in the first episode of season eight, whilst Fox departed in episode seven of the same season. Wallace Langham joined the main cast following Lombard's departure, having recurred since the third season. Fox would return for guest appearances during the ninth season in order to facilitate the departures of both Gary Dourdan and William Petersen, who were replaced by Lauren Lee Smith and Laurence Fishburne, respectively. Smith departed the cast at the end of her first year, and was replaced by a returning Jorja Fox, who featured in a recurring capacity. Liz Vassey and David Berman, who had recurred from season six, and season one, respectively, also joined the cast starting with season ten. Like Smith, Vassey departed the cast after a single season, and was replaced by Fox, who rejoined the main cast. William Petersen would appear in voice clips sporadically over the next three seasons. Fishburne departed the main cast at the end of season eleven, a season that featured guest appearances by Elisabeth Harnois and Louise Lombard, and was replaced by Ted Danson. Danson made his main cast debut alongside Elisabeth Harnois at the start of the twelfth season. Series lead Marg Helgenberger departed the main cast in the twelfth episode of season twelve and was replaced by Elisabeth Shue. Season thirteen saw Jon Wellner join the main cast after eight years a guest star. Helgenberger returned for a single episode in season fourteen, while Paul Guilfoyle departed at the end of the same year, followed by Elisabeth Shue and George Eads at the end of the fifteenth season. The show's finale, a two-hour film, featured the return of Helgenberger, Petersen, and Guilfoyle. The series finale marked their final appearances, as well as the final appearances of Fox, Szmanda, Hall, Langham, Berman, Harnois, and Wellner. Ted Danson went on to reprise his role of Russell during season two of Cyber.\n\nParagraph 8: The remaining three chapters consist of creature statistics and descriptions for fantastic beasts, animals, and beasts of science fiction and the films. Each creature description is about a page in length, and contains a complete listing of the characteristics, powers, skills, and disadvantages, including the point cost for each. This is followed by brief descriptions of the creature's ecology, personality and motivation, powers and combat tactics, their appearance, and the uses of the creature in a role-playing game campaign. The creatures listed include a number that are as intelligent as man (or more so), and can possess their own intricate cultures. All of the creatures are illustrated in black and white.\n\nParagraph 9: Before character generators were available, the primary method of adding titles to video images was to dedicate one camera to shooting white letters on a black background, which then was combined with the video from a live-action camera to form what appeared to be a single image with white letters seemingly superimposed over it. In fact, to this day (and despite the fact that this technology is long-since antiquated by the modern CG) some directors of live TV continue to order the technical director (TD) to \"add the super\" when they want the CG output \"superimposed\" over the image of another camera. As technology advanced, the ability to \"key\" (compositing) these white letters over live video became available, involving electronically \"cutting a hole\" (analogous to cutting a keyhole) in the shape of the letters from the title camera and then electronically adding the letters to the holes cut into the live action camera image. Again, some directors still call this \"keying the graphic\". Finally, the modern CG allowed not only more precise and realistic \"keying\", but also the addition of multiple picture elements from the CG to further the illusion of a three-dimensional graphic physically overlying a video image. The addition of full-motion graphics from the CG and the animation of graphic elements by the CG blur the line between \"character generator\" and \"computer graphics\", combining the CG's ability to elegantly present graphics and video with the computer's ability to interface with game scoring and timing systems, to keep running totals of an athlete's performance on the field or the court and to derive statistics both for individual players and the teams involved, and to interface with computer systems located at other game venues or at a television network's master control central broadcast center. On televised sporting events, score bugs are present. They contain CG data from that game, CG data from other games in progress, other games already completed, and games yet to come, all in an effort to keep the viewer from having to \"channel surf\" to another station to watch another television program. Viewers who do not change channels watch the first channel's television advertising (also included in CG output) which then generates revenue for the television network.\n\nParagraph 10: Wizard, at different points, incorporates prog, psychedelic rock, Broadway show tunes, bubblegum pop, and Philadelphia soul. Other influences were drawn from jazz and funk. Schuckett said that Rundgren often spoke of Ravel as his favorite classical composer at the time, although \"I don't think Todd really listened to much funk, so [me and Moogy] were kind of showing him that stuff.\" Musicologist Daniel Harrison likened  Wizard to late 1960s Beach Boys work such as Smiley Smile, specifically in that the albums shared musical aspects such as \"abrupt transitions, mixture of various pop styles, and unusual production effects.\" Harrison added that few artists in this period chose to emulate the Beach Boys' experiments due to the band's poor commercial standing. Overall, music writers have described Wizard as a work of progressive pop, psychedelia and avant-pop. Rundgren said that adapting his sound to meet commercial expectations was never an issue for him since he already made \"so much money from production\", a rare luxury for an artist. He recalled that Bearsville owner Albert Grossman, however, was \"surprisingly\" encouraging of Wizard. Klingman remembered Grossman walking in on a session of \"Da Da Dali\" and found Rundgren singing in an exaggerated Al Jolson voice while the band were purposely playing \"all wrong notes\", and yet \"Albert didn't miss a beat. ... He just kept silent and nodded like everything was fine.\""}

He became the Danish state leader during the early part of the Second Schleswig War but was criticized for being indecisive during critical moments. During an armistice, he let the king decide on a peace proposal that was ultimately rejected, leading to the continuation of the war and further military defeat. Monrad and his government were dismissed by the king, and the Peace of Vienna resulted in the loss of much of Denmark's territory and its relegation to a minor power. Monrad gave a speech in Parliament calling for continued resistance and against ratifying the peace treaty, even if it seemed like madness to do so.", "The text discusses the concept of credit rationing in a market with imperfect information. It cites the seminal work of Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, who developed a model to show how credit rationing can be an equilibrium feature of the market. This means that a borrower may be willing to pay a higher interest rate than the lender charges, but the lender may not be willing to lend the extra funds due to lower expected profits.\n\nThe text also mentions that market equilibrium can be further enhanced by competition among lenders. In this case, lenders may be willing to accept higher risks than others, resulting in an equilibrium where borrowers who are willing to accept higher risks or pay higher rates can obtain loans. This can happen because lenders have different policies regarding adverse selection, where they face borrowers with different risk levels (types) without knowing the type of each borrower.\n\nThe main idea behind this equilibrium is that safe borrowers would not be willing to accept a high interest rate because they have a low probability of default and will likely end up paying back a large amount. On the other hand, risky borrowers may accept a higher rate because they have a lower chance of a successful project and lower chances of repayment. In this case, the cost of borrowing, or the interest rate paid, increases to account for the additional risk.\n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that when a lender restricts their lending and keeps rates lower, this assumes limited liability and supports the concept of credit rationing. However, the results mentioned in the text could still hold even with unlimited liability.", "The text describes the physical characteristics of a species of lizard. It focuses on details such as the large head with swollen cheeks in adult males, the length of the snout, the size and texture of the scales on different parts of the body, the presence or absence of certain features, and the shape and size of the limbs and tail."], "answers": ["Paragraph 9", "Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 1"], "context": "Paragraph 1: This species of lizard has a large head that is elongated and depressed, with the cheeks swollen in adult males. The snout is longer than the diameter of the orbit (eye cavity). The upper head scales are unequal and smooth or obtusely keeled, the scales being larger on the sinciput (brow) than on the occiput. The canthus rostralis and supraciliary (brow) has a clear and sharp edge, two small separated spines or groups of spines above the ear are present or absent; the diameter of the tympanum is half or a little more than half that of the orbit; it has 10 to 13  upper and as many lower labial scales. The body is slightly flattened; dorsal scales are small, uniform, smooth, or feebly keeled in the adult, and strongly keeled in the young, all pointing backwards and upwards; the dorsal crest is reduced to a ridge of enlarged scales; ventral scales are as large as the dorsals, and smooth (keeled in the young); from 115 to 150 scales occur around the middle of the body; the gular (under chin) scales are a little smaller than the ventral (underside) scales; four or five enlarged scales occur on the chin parallel with the anterior labials, separated from them by two rows of scales; a strong transverse fold covered with small scales is seen across the throat; the nuchal and dorsal crests are merely tooth-like protrusions. The legs are strong, covered with uniform, keeled scales; the hind limb when extended forward in a specimen reaches the ear or the rear end of the eye, and further forward in younger individuals.

In the adult male, it is distinctly swollen at the base, the scales on that part of it are thickened, and those of the upper median row are enlarged.\n\nParagraph 2: Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.\n\nParagraph 3: The \"naturalness\" of nature documentaries has been disputed. Some, particularly those involving animals, have included footage of staged events that appear \"natural\" while actually contrived by filmmakers or occurring in captivity. In a famous example, Walt Disney's White Wilderness (1958), lemmings were herded to their deaths from a cliff by the filmmakers. Examples also occur in modern nature documentaries, such as Hidden Kingdoms (2014) and Blue Planet II (2017), indicating that such practices are still routine. Due to the difficulties of recording sounds on locations, it is common for nature documentary makers to record sounds in post-production using Foley and to use sound effect libraries. Compositing and computer-generated imagery are also sometimes used to construct shots. Wild animals are often filmed over weeks or months, so the footage must be condensed to form a narrative that appears to take place over a short space of time. Such narratives are also constructed to be as compelling as possible—rather than necessarily as a reflection of reality—and make frequent use of voice-overs, combined with emotional and intense music to maximise the audience's engagement with the content. One common technique is to follow the \"story\" of one particular animal, encouraging the audience to form an emotional connection with the subject and to root for their survival when they encounter a predator. In 1984, David Attenborough stated:There is precious little that is natural … in any film. You distort speed if you want to show things like plants growing, or look in detail at the way an animal moves. You distort light levels. You distort distribution, in the sense that you see dozens of different species in a jungle within a few minutes, so that the places seem to be teeming with life. You distort size by using close-up lenses. And you distort sound. What the filmmaker is trying to do is to convey a particular experience. … The viewer has to trust in the good faith of the filmmaker.Nature documentaries have been criticized for leaving viewers with the impression that wild animals survived and thrived after encounters with predators, even when they sustain potentially life-threatening injuries. They also cut away from particularly violent encounters, or attempt to downplay the suffering endured by the individual animal, by appealing to concepts such as the \"balance of nature\" and \"the good of the herd\".\n\nParagraph 4: The Durance is  long from its source at the foot of Sommet des Anges, at  high, above Montgenèvre, to its confluence with the Rhône. However, a longer route is traced by the Clarée-Durance system with a length of . Its descent is unusually rapid at 81 m/km (165 ft/mi) in its first , then 15 m/km (30 ft/mi) to its confluence with the , and then still nearly 8 m/km (16 ft/mi) to the confluence with the Ubaye. This descent stays relatively steep after this confluence, then shallows to approximately 0.33% in its middle course (to the Mirabeau bridge), then 0.24% in its lower course. For comparison, at approximately  from its source, the Isère is at  altitude and the Durance at , which contributes partially to its fast-flowing nature, including in the lower part of the river. It drops  from its source to Mirabeau and approximately  from its source to the confluence with the Rhône.\n\nParagraph 5: Wilde transforms the dance from a public performance for his guests, as in the Bible, to a personal dance for the king himself. He gives no description of the dance beyond the name, but the idea of a series of veils has been connected to a process of unveiling. As Malik says, \"although Wilde does not describe Salome's dance or suggest that she remove any veils, her dance is invariably assumed to be one of unveiling, thus revealing herself.\" Wilde's play has even been proposed as the origin of striptease. Toni Bentley writes \"Wilde's bracketed brevity allowed for a world of interpretation. Can the invention of striptease be traced to a single innocuous stage direction in a censored play that could barely find a theater or audience? Can Oscar Wilde be considered the unlikely father of modern striptease?\"\n\nParagraph 6: The seminal theoretical contribution to the literature is that of Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, who studied credit rationing in a market with imperfect information, in their 1981 paper in the American Economic Review. Stiglitz and Weiss developed a model to illustrate how credit rationing can be an equilibrium feature of the market, in the sense that the rationed borrower would be willing to obtain the funds at an interest rate higher than the one charged by the lender, who may not be willing to lend the extra funds, as the higher rate would imply lower expected profits. This may be an example of equilibrium rationing where there exists excess demand for credit at the equilibrium rate of interest. Market equilibrium may be further enhanced, however, by lenders who are in competition with each other, and where one lender may be willing to accept a higher risk than another which may result in a balance of lending to borrowers who may also be willing to accept a higher risk and/or pay a higher rate to borrow. The reason this may lead to an equilibrium may be that lenders policies regarding adverse selection may vary and the situation where the lender is faced with borrowers whose projects imply different risk levels (types), and the type of each borrower is unbeknownst to the lender. The main intuition behind this result is that safe borrowers would not be willing to tolerate a high interest rate, as, with a low probability of default, they will end up paying back a large amount to the lender. Risky types will accept a higher rate because they have a lower chance of a successful project (and typically a higher return if successful), and thus a lower chance of repayment. Additional risk is taken into account by an increase to the cost of borrowing or rather the interest rate paid. Note that when a lender restricts their lending and decides to keep the rates lower, this assumes limited liability, and supports the notion of credit rationing, though results could still hold with unlimited liability.\n\nParagraph 7: In May 1952, Purtell won the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent William Benton for a seat in the United States Senate. However, when Connecticut's other Democratic Senator, Brien McMahon, died in July of that year, Governor Lodge appointed Purtell to the Senate to fill the remainder of McMahon's term. Thus, Purtell was in the unusual position of filling one Senate seat while running for another. Fellow Republican businessman Prescott Bush, the father of George H. W. Bush and the grandfather of George W. Bush, was later elected to McMahon's seat. During his campaign against Benton, Purtell supported General Eisenhower's campaign platform on \"Communism, corruption, and Korea.\" Benton accused Purtell of being so conservative that he \"makes Bob Taft look like a left-wing New Dealer.\" Still, Benton was defeated by Purtell by a margin of 88,788 votes, receiving 52% of the vote.\n\nParagraph 8: At the start of Season 7, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place, whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them, but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it's a good idea because she'd need him practically, emotionally and sexually. In episode 6, \"The Crack in the Code,\" they decide to buy a two-story house in the suburbs—which they jokingly called \"The Mighty Hut\"—that Booth found at a police auction and renovate it, (according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in \"The Heiress in the Hill\", in season 9, the \"Mighty Hut\"'s address is \"1297 Janus Street, Washington DC, 20002\").  In episode 7, \"The Prisoner in the Pipe\", Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital, but they both know she won't make it in time. This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison. At first, they are rejected and are told to leave, but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan, the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named after Temperance's mother, Christine Brennan, and Temperance's best friend Angela Montenegro). Some time after the delivery, Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian, who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies. In \"The Past in the Present\", Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend, Ethan Sawyer, after supposedly threatening to kill Christine. Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding, but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion. However, at the end of the episode, after Christine is christened in a Catholic church, it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared. Just before Brennan flees town with Christine, she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter. After she is cleared of Sawyer's murder, Brennan, Booth and Christine resume their family life.\n\nParagraph 9: With war approaching, against the advice of the other National Liberal leaders, Monrad formed a government after the resignation of Hall, due to disagreement with Christian IX. As Council President (1863–1864), Monrad was the Danish state leader during the early part of the Second Schleswig War against the German Confederation led by Otto von Bismarck. With none of the other National Liberal bigwigs wanting to continue in office, Monrad became the most, and arguably often the only, important figure for cabinet decision-making. Yet, at critical moments during the war, Monrad was indecisive. Thus, during an armistice, he let the king decide on a peace proposal at the London Conference to divide Schleswig approximately along the language line between majorities of Danish and German speakers (see also the Schleswig-Holstein Question). The king, who held an unrealistic hope to maintain a personal union with the duchies, rejected, the conference ended with no result, and war resumed resulting in further military defeat. Next, the king dismissed Monrad and his government. The Peace of Vienna resulted in the loss of much of the monarchy's territory, including almost all of Schleswig. Denmark was relegated to a minor power. In what was labelled his speech of madness, Monrad spoke in Parliament for continued resistance and against ratifying the peace treaty even if such actions would look like 'madness'.\n\nParagraph 10:  A blind healer Lapis meets in Sable mine after being rescued in the desert. She is something of a leader for the Spars in the capital city, being practical and compassionate as well as possessing powers of healing and divination. When the habit Pyrope raises water taxes and conscripts all the young men in the city, she goes as the representative of the people to beg for mercy from the taxation and the conscription. Pyrope, noticing her beauty, makes a deal with her: no more water taxes and conscription of only half the young men in return for her permanent servitude in his palace. During that time, she comes to fall in love with Pyrope, though he infuriates her with his lewdness and violence. It comes to the point where she saves him after he takes a poisoned arrow for her, and he comes to realize that he cares deeply for her. The two finally consummate their love, though it is revealed that Silica, with her ability of foresight, knew that she was destined to love him, though she tried her very best not to fall in love with him. When Diamond infiltrates the city, she and Pyrope escape the palace, only to face a contingent of Diamond's guard, who take Silica hostage. Unable to risk her, Pyrope becomes seriously injured before killing all the guards. Seeing Pyrope slowly dying, Silica tries to heal him, only to realize that she lost her healing ability because she is pregnant with Pyrope's child. In the meantime, Lapis comes to rescue her, even as Diamond comes charging in. Pyrope stays behind to guard their escape and is killed by Diamond. At his death, Silica faints, lost in grief. It is not explicitly told what happens to her during the years Lapis travels through the mines but it is implied she is in contact with the growing group, though settled down somewhere for the sake of her and Pyrope's son. She does come back to help harden Lapis's resolve with a chilling prophecy given in a trance state. After the wars in the Twelve Mines, she remains as a healer, delivering Carnelian's and Lothesite's child. It is only at that child's christening she finally names her son, naming him Lapis. \"Silica\" is a possible reference to silicon."}

It notes that in the 1950s, Thumboo wrote lyrical poetry inspired by personal experiences and influenced by the English literary tradition. However, he shifted his focus to the public sphere in the 1970s, advocating for the creation of a national literature in post-independence Singapore. His collection of poetry, \"Gods Can Die,\" explored themes related to Singapore's national life. His subsequent anthologies, \"Ulysses by the Merlion\" and \"A Third Map,\" further established his reputation as a national poet committed to expressing a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore. Thumboo is often referred to as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate due to his nationalistic-themed poems and his promotion of Singapore literature. His poem, \"Ulysses by the Merlion,\" was inspired by Irish mythology and history, particularly the works of W.B. Yeats. Thumboo considers himself a myth-inspired poet and views myths as narratives that provide stability in a multicultural society. The poem has also inspired other Singaporean poets to write their own Merlion-themed verses. A copy of \"Ulysses\" is installed on a plaque near the Merlion statue in Singapore.", "The German East Africa Company, also known as DOAG, was a colonial organization that played a significant role in the establishment of German East Africa, which encompassed modern-day Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. Originally founded in 1884 as the Society for German Colonisation, the company aimed to engage in trade within Africa. It obtained a separate German sphere of influence in Wituland, within present-day Kenya, in 1885. The company leased a coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years, but its attempt to take over administration led to a revolt along the coast of Tanzania. With the assistance of the German navy, the company managed to maintain control of Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo, but in 1889, it had to seek help from the German government to suppress the rebellion. Unable to effectively govern its dominions, the company sold out to the German government in 1891, which then assumed direct rule over German East Africa. The company continued to operate various activities, such as mines, plantations, railways, banking, and minting, until it relinquished them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. During World War I, British forces occupied German East Africa, bringing an end to the operations of the German East Africa Company."], "answers": ["Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 8", "Paragraph 10"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Back in Turkey, Azmi's wife Güzin receives one of his letters. She frets because it is the first she has heard from him in ten days. Güzin spends her time with her best friend, Sadan. Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately, though Sadan seems happy as she recently became engaged to Turan. Güzin and Sadan go to the seashore, and while taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disappeared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. Güzin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. Güzin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif, and Dr. Nuri is called to examine Sadan, noticing that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. Güzin meanwhile learns that Azmi is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr. Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan, and also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan's mother removes the necklace, and The Count breaks the window to Sadan's room and attacks her. Sadan's mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, the marks from her neck have vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as a vampire, who preys on children. Dr. Nuri, Azmi, Güzin, Dr. Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr. Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children's throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan's wounds, but were made by Sadan herself.

The song was certified platinum and is part of her multi-platinum album Blown Away. He also wrote Colbie Caillat's \"When The Darkness Comes\" for Sony Screen Gem's film The Mortal Instruments. In October 2014, David also helped in writing the song \"Faith\" with musician and author Lacey Sturm for her album Life Screams. In 2015, he co-wrote \"The Girl You Think I Am\" with Carrie Underwood. The song was released on her new album Storyteller which was the No. 2 album in the US the same week the 5 Seconds of Summer album was released, which took the No. 1 spot. Hodges co-wrote and produced a song on 5 Seconds of Summer's second album. The song, \"Jet Black Heart\", was released in August 2015, in anticipation for the album Sounds Good Feels Good street date in October, and it quickly became a single.

The song is also included in SingStar Pop, a PlayStation 2 game and another cover version is featured in Rock Revolution by Konami. The song was also used in a montage of funny rollerskates and skateboard clips in an edition of America's Funniest Home Videos. \"Sk8er Boi\" was featured in the television series Cold Case (Season 3, \"The Promise\", 2 October 2005). In 2008, HBO included the song in the episode \"Get Some\" of the miniseries Generation Kill. The song is sung by Cpl. Josh Ray Person as he is urinating in the desert.

It has grown from a locally sponsored event to one with major corporate presence and is seen as a signal of the impending end of summer and beginning of the new school year. As such the parade sponsors raise money for college scholarships for local youth. The parade route has changed over the years. The original route was along Michigan Avenue beginning at 31st Street, then turned east into Washington Park. Complaints for north–south traffic flow caused rerouting the parade route to South Parkway (now named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive), which runs directly into the park. At various times, street repairs have necessitated use of the Michigan route, but the current route is now the King Drive route. Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll of Amos 'n' Andy were the first guests in the first parade. Robert S. Abbott led the first parade in his Rolls-Royce. Dr. Marjorie Stewart Joyner, president of the Chicago Defender Charities, Inc., organized the parade for over 50 years. Numerous high-profile celebrities and dignitaries have attended the parade over the years, including U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Michael Jordan, Barack Obama, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Duke Ellington, Adelaide Hall, Oprah Winfrey, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Lena Horne, James Brown, Ethel Waters, Cab Calloway, Paul Robeson, Chaka Khan and Billie Holiday. Truman rode alongside John H. Sengstacke, who was Abbott's nephew and took over the Chicago Defender in 1948, and Mayor Richard J. Daley in the 1956 Parade. Recent parades have featured popular musical acts as concert performers at the post-parade picnic. In 2006, approximately 26 million people saw the parade, including 25 million television viewers and 1.2 million attendees. The 2006 parade included 74,000 participants and 160 floats and vehicles. The 2008 parade was dedicated to actor and comedian  Bernie Mac (star of The Bernie Mac Show) and a native of Chicago; he died an hour before the start of the parade. In 1993, a request by a black LGBT group to participate in the parade was declined by the organizers. Following legal action and the involvement of Lambda Legal, the Ad Hoc Committee of Proud Black Lesbians and Gays was allowed to participate in the parade the following year. The 2020 parade, marking its 91st year, saw the first-ever cancellation, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A \"scaled down\" event was held in 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: In Roland a Saragosse, Oliver appears as Roland's friend and also something of a caretaker, assigned by Charlemagne to watch out for the younger and somewhat impetuous Roland.  In the story, Roland is invited by Brammimonde, the queen of the Moors, to visit her at Saragossa.  He and Oliver ride to the city without Roland telling Oliver the nature of his errand.  As the two look out over the city, Roland asks Oliver to promise him a favour. Oliver, not suspecting any foul play, readily agrees, rather like an older brother to a younger. Roland asks Oliver to not accompany him into Saragosse so that Roland can claim all the glory and all the Queen's favor for himself.  He leaves an outraged Oliver behind and succeeds in finding the queen and receiving a magnificent cloak from her.  However, as he attempts to escape Saragossa Roland is surrounded by Saracens.  He calls to Oliver for help, but the latter does not budge from his hill.  Only when Roland is unhorsed and seems in grave danger of capture does Oliver, after a little more hesitation, ride down to the battle.  He kills many Saracens and then leads a horse to Roland, then leaves the battle again.  Then Oliver and his knights angrily leave Charlemagne's camp and capture the minor Saracen city of Gorreya.  Roland rides out after them, intending to apologise to Oliver.  When he arrives at Gorreya, Oliver disguises himself as a Saracen and goes outside the city to do battle with Roland.  Roland knocks Oliver off his horse, but at a signal from Oliver all of the rest of his knights, also disguised as Saracens, exit the city and surround Roland.  Just as before, outside Saragossa, Roland is trapped and outnumbered, and this time, realising that Oliver is not there to save him, Roland surrenders.  Only then does Oliver remove his disguise and the two are reconciled.\n\nParagraph 6: Denny Varney and Eugene Johnson are rehearsing for the “Dream of a Lifetime” Talent Search (“Life Could Be a Dream (Sh-Boom)”), hosted by Big Whopper Radio. Denny, a former member of the Crooning Crab Cakes glee club at Springfield High School, grabs the spotlight as Eugene struggles to keep up with him. They rehearse in Denny's basement, and it becomes clear when their friend Wally arrives that Denny's mother is ready for him to grow up and move out (“Get a Job”). Wally Patton joins the singing group and suggests they ask if Big Stuff Auto will sponsor them in the contest. Denny's mother, Mrs. Varney, tells the boys to keep the noise down, but no one can stifle these boys and their musical ambitions (“Mama Don't Allow It”). The next night the boys are anxiously awaiting their audition for “Big” Earl, the owner of Big Stuff Auto, when mechanic Duke Henderson shows up instead. Trouble comes in the form of Lois Franklin, “Big” Earl's daughter, who shows up to help Duke evaluate the group, but who also broke Eugene's heart many years before. Eugene works through his pain as the boys audition (“Tears on my Pillow”). Lois likes the boys, but thinks they need to add a fourth member to become a proper doo-wop quartet. After hearing Duke sing (“Fools Fall in Love”), the boys welcome him into the group and Lois realizes her budding romantic feelings for him. As the newly formed quartet rehearses, Denny struggles with Duke singing lead (“Runaround Sue”). Lois tries to add polish to the rough edges of their act (“Lonely Teardrops”), triggering Wally, Eugene, and Denny to fantasize about their love for her (“Lovin' Lois Medley”). Little do the boys realize that Lois has fallen hard for Duke (“I Only Have Eyes for You”), and she surprises him with a kiss. Duke is startled and runs off, leaving the boys oblivious to the unfolding drama, begging Lois to stay and rehearse with them (“Stay”). The next night, Denny, Wally, and Eugene rehearse while imagining themselves with Lois (“(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet”), when Duke arrives to offer the guys some advice about girls and love in general (“A Sunday Kind of Love”). When Lois arrives, Duke quits the group and runs out. Lois tells the boys that she told her parents she was in love with Duke, and then her father fired Duke from the Auto Shop. Lois laments her unrequited love (“Unchained Melody”).\n\nParagraph 7: They also towed targets for live anti-aircraft artillery practice, simulated strafing missions, and transported cargo. The live-target practice was announced by Jackie Cochran on July 19, 1943, to 25 recent WASP graduates at Avenger Field. Cochran told the group that she had a \"top secret assignment\" and that any WASP could opt out if they wished: none did. This group would be sent to Camp Davis to tow flying shooting targets for men on the ground to practice shooting airborne targets. Many of the planes were shot during this training and several WASP were shot in the feet. Sometimes the planes were shot on purpose, when service men mistakenly believed they were supposed to shoot the plane, not the target the WASP was towing. One of the planes used during target towing, an A-24 that, like many had not been adequately maintained by the Army Air Corps (AAC), killed WASP Mabel Virginia Rawlinson. Rawlinson was practicing night flying with a trainer when her A-24 began to experience technical issues. The instructor asked her to return to the airfield, but on the final approach, Rawlinson's plane connected with the top of a pine tree and the plane nosed down and crashed. The instructor was thrown free, but Rawlinson was stuck in the front seat as the plane went up in flames, unable to open the plane's broken canopy lock. The investigation into the crash and her death found that the towing planes were not maintained properly and the AAC was using the wrong octane fuel for the planes.\n\nParagraph 8: In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry based on personal experiences. Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) \"established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore\". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August – II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa. Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a \"Merlion poem\". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue.\n\nParagraph 9: Queen of Fables appears in the DC Universe animated series Harley Quinn, voiced by Wanda Sykes. This version's powers are derived from a magical storybook from which she can conjure storybook characters to do her bidding. Introduced in \"So, You Need a Crew?\", she attempted to break the glass ceiling for female supervillains in the 1980s by turning Gotham into an enchanted forest kingdom with an army of storybook characters. However, she was defeated by the Justice League and transformed into a talking U.S. Master Tax Guide Book by Zatanna, leaving the Queen annoyed about not being thrown in Arkham Asylum \"like any male villain\". Following this, she gained a job as a tax consultant. In \"The Line\", she is freed from the tax code by a court order that deemed it to be a cruel and unusual punishment, though she is ironically sentenced to serve the rest of her term at Arkham. Harley Quinn breaks her out in transit and the Queen temporarily joins her crew before her extreme and violent methods lead to her being ousted. After the crew steals a weather control device to ransom Gotham, the Queen attempts to steal it for herself, but they are interrupted by Jason Praxis, a surviving member of a family she had slaughtered with electrical powers who sought revenge on the Queen. He destroys her storybook, but Harley uses a force field device she and her crew previously stole to protect the Queen and subdue Praxis before getting the former to leave. Killing Praxis on her way out, the Queen promises Harley will regret letting her live. In the episode \"Devil's Snare\", having formed an alliance with the Joker and acquired a new storybook, the Queen traps the Justice League in it before sending Harley and her crew up a beanstalk to be killed by a giant cyclops. After getting down with Kite Man's help, Harley kills the Queen. As of \"A Fight Worth Fighting For\", the Book of Fables fell into the possession of a nurse named Bethany after Joker was rendered sane and gave it to her. Once a restored Joker retrieved it for Harley, Batman has Zatanna free the Justice League from it. The Queen later appears during an in memoriam segment during a villain's award show in season 3.\n\nParagraph 10: The German East Africa Company (, abbreviated DOAG) was a chartered colonial organization which brought about the establishment of German East Africa, a territory which eventually comprised the areas of modern Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The company originated in 1884 as the  (Society for German Colonisation) with the aim of trading in Africa. The German protectorate of Wituland (within modern Kenya) originated as a separate German sphere of influence in 1885. In April of the same year, the company leased the coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years. Its attempt to take over the administration led to a general revolt along the coast of what is now Tanzania. The company could only hold Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo with the help of the German navy. In 1889 it had to request the assistance of the German government to put down the rebellion. In 1891, after it became apparent that the company could not handle its dominions, it sold out to the German government, which began to rule German East Africa directly. The company initially continued to operate its many activities, including mines, plantations, railways, banking, minting, etc., before it consented to relinquish them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. It subsequently operated as a land company within the German territory until Britain occupied German East Africa during World War I."}

When the buffalo disappears, the elder sister goes searching for it and encounters a little bird that asks her to marry it. She refuses and returns home. The middle sister also encounters the bird but declines its proposition. Finally, the youngest sister agrees to marry the bird and is led into a cave with magnificent rooms. The bird reveals that their buffalo was eaten by an evil raksha and the girl becomes the bird's wife. One day, she attends a festival and meets a handsome youth who is actually her husband in disguise. An old woman advises her to burn the bird's skin to reveal his true form. When she does, her husband, who is a prince, reappears and is taken away by a whirlwind. The girl sets out to find him and eventually does near a temple. He instructs her to make a new bird skin coat and chant a prayer to bring him back. She follows the instructions, and they live happily together.", "Command guidance is a missile guidance system that relies on a ground or ship-based radar to track both the target and the missile. This system allows for the equipment necessary for missile guidance to be located at the launcher, where size and weight constraints are less important. The radar tracks the target and the missile separately, enabling them to follow independent and widely separated paths. A computer then calculates the position and velocity of both the target and the missile, determining an intercept point. Based on this information, the computer calculates the control inputs needed to guide the missile to the intercept point. Any necessary corrections are then sent to the missile via a radio signal, often using the radar tracking the missile as the radio signal.", "This text is a summary of the career of a football player named Mason. He was drafted by the Oilers/Titans in 1997 and played in all 16 games in his rookie season. He had a total of 14 catches for 186 yards and made his NFL debut against the Oakland Raiders. In the following season, he played in all 16 games again and recorded 25 catches for 333 yards and three touchdowns. He also returned punts for 228 yards. In 1999, Mason had a successful season, gaining 1,030 yards returning punts and kickoffs and scoring a touchdown in the playoffs. He helped the Titans reach Super Bowl XXXIV, where he had a strong performance. In the 2000 season, he broke the NFL record for all-purpose yards in a single season and earned his first trip to the Pro Bowl. In 2001, he surpassed the 2,000 all-purpose yards mark for the second consecutive season and scored a career-high 9 touchdowns. He continued to excel in the following seasons, leading the team in various categories and earning high rankings in the NFL."], "answers": ["Paragraph 3", "Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 2"], "context": "Paragraph 1: As a result of the change in role and more relaxed weight limits of a vehicle-mounted SAM, the design team made the 9M31 a much heavier missile, which permitted fewer design compromises than in the case of Strela-2 to achieve acceptable kinematic performance. The most notable difference is the much larger diameter of the missile and a blunt seeker head spanning the full width of the missile. With all else being equal, the ability of an optical seeker to detect a target is directly proportional to its diameter, but on the other hand aerodynamic drag increases proportionally to the square of the diameter.\n\nParagraph 2: Mason started his career with the Oilers/Titans after being drafted in the fourth round (98th overall) in the 1997 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he played in 16 games recording 14 catches for 186 yards. He made his NFL debut versus the Oakland Raiders on August 31. The following season, he again played in all 16 games and this time recording 25 catches for 333 yards and three touchdowns, the first of his career came versus the Chicago Bears on October 25. He also returned 31 punts for 228 yards. In the 1999 season, Mason gained 1,030 yards returning punts and kickoffs, and added 8 kickoff returns for 322 yards and a touchdown in the team's three playoff games,  assisting the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV where he returned 5 kickoffs for 122 yards and caught 2 passes for 18 yards in Tennessee's 23–16 loss. He also returned a kickoff 80 yards for a touchdown in the Titans 33-14 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC title game. In the 2000 season, he led the NFL in punt return yards (662) while also catching 63 passes for 895 yards and returning 41 kickoffs for 1,132 yards (an NFL leading 27 yards per return average), giving him 2,690 combined receiving and special teams yards, breaking the NFL record for all-purpose yards in a single season previously held by Lionel James (2,535). Darren Sproles broke Mason's record in 2011 with 2,696 yards. He is only the second player in Titans history to pass the 2,000 yard mark. He earned his first trip to the Pro Bowl. In 2001, he started 15 games and scored 9 touchdowns, a career-high. Just as he had done the previous season, he went past the 2,000 all purpose yards mark, the first Titan to do this in consecutive seasons. The following season, he started in 14 games and led the team in a number of categories including receptions, reception yards and touchdowns. In 2003, he started all 16 games and finished the season with 1,303 receiving yards and 95 receptions which was the 5th highest in the NFL. The following season, in 2004, he again started all 16 games and was ranked 2nd in the NFL with 96 receptions for 1,168 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nParagraph 3: In a variant translated as \"Царевич в птичьей оболочке\" (\"The Prince in Bird Skin\") or The Feathered Prince, three orphaned sisters live together and earn their living by milking their female buffalo and selling its milk and butter. One day, the animal disappears, and the elder sister goes looking for it. After a while, she sits by a rock near a cave. A little bird appears to her and begs for some food, and asks her to marry it. The elder sister refuses and returns home. The next day, the middle sister goes to look for the animal and rests by the same stone, and the same white bird propositions her, but she declines. Lastly, the youngest sister agrees to marry the white bird, and he directs her into the cave. Inside, magnificent and richly decorated rooms appear before her with every door she opens. At last, the little bird perches upon a couch and tells her that their buffalo was devoured by an evil raksha. The girl begins to live there as the white bird's wife, tidying the place and preparing the food. Some time later, a festival is held in a nearby village, with musicians, equestrian games, and all sorts of amusement. The white bird's wife goes to the festival, and sees a handsome youth on a gray horse, who gazes at her. The girl leaves the festival and meets an old woman. The girl pours out her woes to her, lamenting over the fact that her husband is just a little bird, but the old woman reassures her that the youth at the festival was her husband, and that she only has to burn his bird disguise the next time. The girl follows the old woman's instructions the next day, and burns the bird skin. The same night, her husband (in human form) comes home and asks her about the bird skin. The girl tells him she burned the birdskin, and the man reveals he is a prince, and that the birdskin was to protect him from an evil witch. Saying this, a whirlwind comes and takes the prince. The girl tries to find him and wanders through valleys and deserts, until she finds him one day near a temple, carrying jugs of water and wearing faded boots. The prince tells her to get feathers from all species of bird for a new bird coat, and, once she has fashioned it, she must chant a special prayer for him to return to her. Saying his, he disappears. The girl returns to their cave palace and gathers all feathers she can must, fashions a new bird skin and chants the correct chant to summon her husband back to her. He appears and both live happily.\n\nParagraph 4: Terry reappears in August 1999 and buys his mother Vera a posh car. The car is revealed as being a death trap when it is involved in a car crash which indirectly resulted in the death of Judy Mallett the following month. On Christmas Day, Terry interrupts a Christmas dinner and is punched by Judy's husband Gary for causing Judy's death. Jack then tells his son how much misery he had brought down on Gary, and told him to never return to Coronation Street again. Alone with Terry, Vera finally stands up to her son, telling him he is evil and she slaps him. Terry resented  Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) when he moved in and became a son to Jack and Vera. In November 2000, when his son Paul needed a kidney transplant, Terry returned and offered to be a donor for a price. But once he received the money he does a runner, leaving his mother Vera to donate instead. Reading a letter penned to him by Vera in case the worst should happen, she admitted to Jack a fling early in their marriage which cast doubt on Terry's paternity. Jack admits to Curly that he knew of the affair, but also had no doubt in his mind that Terry was his son as he reminded Jack too much of himself. The operation saves Paul's life, Vera nearly dies when she had an allergic reaction. Terry, in a rare show of heart, returns to the hospital to make sure his mother was okay before disappearing once again. Jack and Vera hear Terry once again when he is imprisoned again in October 2001. He claims, he has been framed for an attempted murder by a policeman who wanted revenge because Terry had been having an affair with his wife. This is revealed to be true, and Jack helps him, despite his better instincts. Terry is released from prison in January 2002 when he is proven innocent. He subsequently makes peace with Jack and Vera. Terry eventually sets up home with a girlfriend called Nadine in Sheffield, and had a job selling double glazing. He later moves to Wolverhampton and began selling mobile phones.\n\nParagraph 5: Miller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi, as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left him to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as his ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade, where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take him out, feuding with Scott Norton. For a time, he started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had \"purchased\", but it was short-lived, and he soon returned to his James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn, with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting him with a crowbar. He and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash, but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan, who Miller defeated after kicking him with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe.\n\nParagraph 6: Command guidance has the advantage of isolating most of the equipment for the missile guidance at the launcher, where size and weight are significantly less important. In these systems, the radar that provides guidance is on the ground or ship and the missile lacks an independent guidance system. Typically two radars are used, one tracking the target and another the missile, so that they can fly independent and widely separated paths. A computer then calculates the position and velocity of the two and calculates an intercept point. The same computer then calculates the control inputs needed to fly the missile to that point and sends any required corrections to the missile via a radio signal, often using the radar tracking the missile as the radio signal.\n\nParagraph 7: There are two envelope glycoproteins. The G glycoprotein ectodomain assembles as a homotetramer to form the viral anti-receptor or attachment protein, which binds to the receptor on the host cell. Each strand in the ectodomain consists of four distinct regions: at the N-terminal and connecting to the viral surface is the helical stalk, followed by the beta-sandwich neck domain, the linker region and finally, at the C-terminal, four heads which contain host cell receptor binding domains.  Each head consists of a beta-propellor structure with six blades. There are three unique folding patterns of the heads, resulting in a 2-up/2-down configuration where two heads are positioned distal to the virus and two heads are proximal. Due to the folding patterns and subsequent arrangement of the heads, only one of the four heads is positioned with its binding site accessible to associate with the host B2/B3 receptor. The G protein head domain is also highly antigenic, inducing head-specific antibodies in primate models. As such, it is a prime target for vaccine development as well as antibody therapy. One head-specific antibody, m102.4, has been used in compassionate use cases and has completed Phase 1 clinical trials.  The F glycoprotein forms a trimer, which mediates membrane fusion.\n\nParagraph 8: Jamair was formed in 1946 by James B Muff, a former Chief Engineer at China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Eddie Quinn, a radio operator and pilot with CNAC. They were financially backed by the Maharajah Jam Sahib of Nawanagar and so was based out of Jamnagar where the Maharaja developed an air base for the aircraft. In 1949 - 50 they bought the Maharajah's interests in the business and moved to Dum Dum Airport in Calcutta, West Bengal with a fleet of 5 C47/DC 3s, loads of spares and a small engineering team. Mr.C.L.Chandak and his brother Mr.P.C.Chandak the experienced  business family were taken in to Board as Directors and  Jamair began operating air supply missions to nearby states in the North East, but as commercial trade improved rapidly post WW11, the Airline began receiving Charter orders from export houses and so began International cargo services as far away as South America & Europe. After nationalisation of internal routes in August 1953, Jamair reverted to being a private charter company. Business picked up soon and charters to major Indian cities like Bombay, Bangalore and Delhi were added to their schedule. In early sixties, this airline also used to operate from Delhi Safdarjung Airport to Jodhpur, Bikaner and Sriganganagar in Rajasthan. In 1951, Herbert Dequadros aka Bob Dequadros from Burma Air joined the team as head Engineer and General Manager and with his expertise the airline grew in business and expanded in 1974 with additional 3 DC 4s purchased from Indian Airlines. These large bodied aircraft were commissioned to fly on commercial routes carrying passengers from Calcutta to Bombay via Panagarh in West Bengal. Out of the 3 aircraft, one was de-commissioned for scrap and spares were used to keep the balance 2 flying. However, these planes proved too costly for the Airline and in 1975, they were re -sold to private operator Air Works India in Bombay. The DC 3s remained in the fleet with 2 out of 5 meeting with accidents, some severely with loss of lives. In 1976, the first batch of Boeing 737s came into operations by Indian Airlines and the DGCA authorised the aircraft to service similar Jamair routes, thus leading to losses for the old airline. Around 1966, the company invited a business partner so as to financially sustain the Airline, but this proved troublesome for the original owners over the years and the company became embroiled in legal battles right to the last day of operations. In 1971, Bob Dequadros became the 3rd partner with 40% stake in the Airline. Founder partner James B. Muff remained in New Delhi for the latter part of his life overseeing operations from the Northern part of India. He eventually became ill and died in Calcutta in 1977. Rising fuel costs, labor problems, local competition, a shrinking fleet and legal battles between partners eventually broke the company apart and in late 1977 operations ceased. The demise of James B. Muff left partner Bob Dequadros to conclude the numerous legal battles till his death in 1981. The remaining DC3s were scrapped in 1978 and money from the scrap dealers went to pay off staff and legal fees.\n\nParagraph 9: From the 2005 season until 2020, at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark following Staten Island Yankees games, the Sinatra version was heard regardless of the game's outcome, and was formerly done at Shea Stadium at the end of New York Mets games after the September 11, 2001 attack. Previously, Mets fans felt it was a \"Yankee song\", and began booing it when it was played. It actually first had snippets of the song played after World Series home runs by Ray Knight and Darryl Strawberry during Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. The song is also sometimes played at New York Knicks games. The Sinatra version is played at the end of every New York Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. It was played at the opening faceoff of Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals at the Garden. The song has also been the post parade song for the Belmont Stakes from 1997 to 2009, and since 2011. Sinatra's version of the song has been played at the end of all four Super Bowls that the New York Giants have won to date, as well as before kickoff of Super Bowl XLVIII, while Minnelli's version was heard after the Giants' Super Bowl XXXV loss.\n\nParagraph 10: Everett's tightknit family respond awkwardly, and soon coldly, to Meredith's stiffness, making her feel like even more of an outsider. Ben, Everett's brother, is the only one who seems to like Meredith. After a series of embarrassing moments, Meredith opts to stay at the local inn and begs her sister Julie to take a bus down to Thayer and join her for support. Everett finds himself drawn to the friendly, more outgoing Julie, whom his family receives very warmly, after Julie has a fall while getting off the bus. Meredith desperately tries to fit in with the Stones, but her strained attempts prove disastrous. During dinner, Everett's gay, deaf brother Thad and his partner Patrick express their plans to adopt a child, prompting a discussion about nature versus nurture and sexual orientation. When Meredith clumsily attempts to engage in the conversation, her choice of words offends everyone and Everett's father Kelly, the most understanding of the family, angrily shuts her down. Distraught, Meredith attempts to drive off but crashes Everett's car, and Ben comes to comfort her. Ben's attraction to Meredith is apparent and the two of them end up at a local bar where, after several drinks, Meredith begins to enjoy herself. She invites Amy's high school flame and local paramedic, Brad Stevenson, to the Stones' house for Christmas breakfast. The next morning, she awakens in Ben's bed and incorrectly assumes that they had sex."}
{"queries": ["The text explains that Jay Kay wrote the first track \"When You Gonna Learn\" while sending songs to record companies. The song was inspired by Native American and First Nation peoples, as well as Kay's anger towards the shooting of elephants. The track addresses various issues such as racism and corporate greed. After recording the song, Kay had a disagreement with his producer who made changes to the lyrics based on popular trends. This experience made Kay realize that he wanted a live band with a live sound. As a result, he named the band \"Jamiroquai\", combining the words \"jam\" and the Iroquois, a Native American confederacy.", "The doctrine of blood atonement, a controversial belief in Mormonism, suggests that Jesus' atonement does not redeem certain sins. According to this doctrine, individuals who commit eternal sins must be killed in a way that allows their blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering. This is done to prevent them from becoming sons of perdition. However, the largest Mormon denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has rejected this doctrine since 1889. Early church leaders dismissed it as a \"fiction,\" while later leaders regarded it as a \"theoretical principle\" that was never practiced in the LDS Church.", "The electrification plebiscite in Alberta was the fourth province-wide plebiscite conducted. The ballot presented two options on electricity generation and transmission: creating a publicly-owned utility administered by the Alberta Government Power Commission, or leaving the industry in the hands of existing companies.

Historic contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals has put the canal under the EPA's Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AoC)—the only AoC to be listed impaired in all 14 beneficial use categories. Because of this sediment contamination, no dredging has taken place in the harbor since 1972, when the USEPA determined the previous sediment disposal method of open water disposal in Lake Michigan to be unacceptable.  Lacking any alternative disposal location, the harbor and canal have accumulated a backlog of approximately  of sediment, which hinders deep draft commercial navigation.  Shipping capacity has been reduced by 15%, increasing shipping costs. The contaminated sediment also leads to further pollution of Lake Michigan, as sediments containing  of chromium,  of lead, and  of PCBs reach the lake each year through the waterway.\n\nParagraph 2: The electrification plebiscite was the fourth plebiscite conducted province-wide in Alberta's history. The ballot was not a traditional yes/no question, but presented two options on electricity generation and transmission, asking if the province should create \"a publicly-owned utility administered by the Alberta Government Power Commission\" or leave the electricity industry in the hands of companies already in the business (a mixture of municipal operations and private companies). The driving force behind the referendum was whether to provide rural electrification through public ownership or leave it in the hands of private corporations that had done very little up to that time and did not have the financial resources to perform the task. Despite the referendum result, the government sponsored the creation of many Rural Electrification Associations, of which some still exist today.\n\nParagraph 3: Modern Sadras was established as part of Dutch Coromandel in the seventeenth century, which was even before center for weaving superfine muslin cloth for export besides Pearl and edible oil. The magnificent Sadras Fort, built for commercial purposes by the Dutch, is a vast compound enclosing a huge granary, stables, and structures used to mount elephants. Unfortunately, only one of these structures survives. The fortress was raided by the British in 1818 and came under the control of the British East India Company. It is now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India in efforts to contain further dilapidation. In 2003, a major restoration of the damaged fort was carried out leading to many archaeological findings. The first battle between British East India Company and the Dutch started here as Battle of Sadras. The fort includes a cemetery with many beautifully decorated graves that date to between 1620 and 1769.\n\nParagraph 4: Blood atonement is a disputed doctrine in the history of Mormonism, under which the atonement of Jesus does not redeem an eternal sin. To atone for an eternal sin, the sinner should be killed in a way that allows his blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering, so he does not become a son of perdition. The largest Mormon denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), has denied the validity of the doctrine since 1889 with early church leaders referring to it as a \"fiction\" and later church leaders referring to it as a \"theoretical principle\" that had never been implemented in the LDS Church.\n\nParagraph 5: The monorail uses nine fully automatic Bombardier MVI trains, each consisting of four cars. These are very similar to the six-car Mark VI monorails at Walt Disney World (which were operated by pilots until 2014). The guideway is built to the \"ALWEG\" track standard. For the first seven years, the line only ran as the MGM Shuttle, between MGM and Bally's stations. During this time, two ex-Walt Disney World Mark IV monorail trains were used.  Though the Las Vegas and related train equipment appear superficially similar to the original ALWEG design (as exemplified by the Seattle system), their suspension and propulsion systems differ substantially.  A Seattle train may be walked end-to-end which is impossible on a Las Vegas or Florida train. The ALWEG Mark VI system used in Las Vegas Monorail consists of two inline large truck tires per car that support the load over the concrete guideway with a rectangular cross section and eight guide tires that straddle the guideway from both sides. The total capacity of the four-car trains is roughly equivalent to two articulated buses at 80 seated and 160 standing passengers. The maximum speed is , although that speed is only reached during one short straight segment of the line.\n\nParagraph 6: While Jay Kay was sending songs to record companies, he wrote the first track \"When You Gonna Learn\" after taking inspiration from Native American and First Nation peoples and their philosophies, and from his anger towards the shooting of elephants in a television programme. The song also \"takes on everything from racism to corporate greed\" according to Interview. Kay said the track laid down \"the sound, the flavor [and] the concept\" of the album. After he had it recorded, Kay fought with his producer, who took out half the lyrics and produced the song based on what was charting at the time. With the track restored to his preference, the experience helped Kay realise he \"wanted a proper live band with a proper live sound\". The band would be named \"Jamiroquai\", a blend of the words \"jam\" and the name of a Native American confederacy, the Iroquois.\n\nParagraph 7: Though Sorai was best known for being a teacher of Confucianism he was also called on to find answers to some of the economic issues that arose alongside the growing economy, the most notable of which was the rising inflation and prices that began after the debasement of coinage in 1695. The Tokugawa shogunate carried out a total of 12 recoinages between 1695 and the start of the Meiji Restoration in 1868 debasing the currency in an attempt to match the rising demand for money as the commercial economy rapidly expanded. There was an attempt to quell the inflation and high prices in 1714 when the government reminted coins in an effort to reduce the amount of gold in circulation, however this exacerbated the problem as the old coins remained in circulation alongside the newly minted coins. In response to the currency reforms Sorai noted that the monetary policies enacted failed as they only accounted for one of the causes of high prices and inflation. Sorai realized that there were more than just monetary influences that needed to be taken into account to address the problem. He noted that since the large cities like Edo had become the center of large markets one had to consider the costs of tariffs and transportation from distant provinces as well as the costs of land and housing in the cities into final prices. Additionally, there was a breakdown of the traditional class distinctions where commoners were able to buy goods that were once reserved for the higher classes which pushed up prices. Finally, he pointed out that as the merchant class grew in power they began to collude and fix prices above what was normal. It was all of these factors together, in addition to the monetary influences, that caused wealth and power to shift away from the shogun and into the hands of the merchants which prompted the debasement of coinage leading to inflation and exorbitant prices.\n\nParagraph 8: Gaston Le Breton (1845-1920) - Léon de Vesly (1844-1920) - André Dubosc (-1935) - Georges Dubosc (1854-1927) - Raoul Aubé (1846-1921) - Édouard Duveau (1839-1917) - Narcisse Beaurain - Edmond Bonet - Émile Bellon - Charles Collette - G.

Here in November 1708 was elected a new Hetman of Zaporizhian Host Ivan Skoropadsky, while the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych and all Little Russia Ioasaf was forced to proclaim anathema onto Mazepa in the St. Trinity Cathedral (destroyed in 1962). Hlukhiv served as the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1708-64 and until 1773 the administrative center of the Little Russia Governorate. Under the last hetmans of Ukraine, the town was remodeled in the Baroque style. Subsequently, it declined in consequence of frequent fires, so that very few of its architectural gems survived.\n\nParagraph 10: The Catholic Encyclopedia (1907–14) writes: \"The view that Bethulia is merely a symbolic name for Jerusalem or a fictitious town, has met with little favor, even among those who deny the historical character of the book. Bethulia is clearly distinguished from Jerusalem (; the references throughout the article being to the fuller Greek text), and the topographical details\" show that \"the story, even if it be only a pious romance, is connected with a definite place. Its site, however, is in dispute. Beside Sanur, Mithilîyeh or Misilîyeh, Tell Kheibar and Beit-Ilfa, which have divided opinion for some time, Haraiq el-Mallah, Khirbet Sheikh Shibel, el-Bârid and Sichem (Bethulia being considered a pseudonym) have [as of the beginning of the 20th century] recently been proposed as sites of Bethulia.\" However, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1901–1906) considers \"fort Sânûr\", Guérin's choice for Bethulia, to be too far south, which applies to a smaller degree also to Mithilîyeh (Misilyah), the only candidate with a name even slightly similar to that of the biblical town. The Catholic Encyclopedia further writes: \"The city was situated on a mountain overlooking the plain of Jezrael, or Esdrelon, and commanding narrow passes to the south (); at the foot of the mountain there was an important spring, and other springs were in the neighborhood (). Moreover it lay within investing lines which ran through Dothain, or Dothan, now Tell Dothân, to Belthem, or Belma, no doubt the same as the Belamon of , and thence to Kyamon, or Chelmon, \"which lies over against Esdrelon\" (). These data point to a site on the heights west of Jenin (Engannim), between the plains of Esdrelon and Dothan, where Haraiq, Kh. Sheikh Shibel, and el-Bârid lie close together. Such a site best fulfills all requirements. It lies between lines drawn from Tell Dothân to Belʽema, probably Belma, or Belamon, and from the latter to el-Yâmûn, probably Kyamon; there are a number of springs and wells in the neighborhood, and nearby are the two passes of Kefr Adân and Burqîn, so narrow in places that two horsemen cannot ride abreast. One of the three above-named places is in all probability the site of ancient Bethulia. The other sites are all deficient in some essential requirement.\" The Jewish Encyclopedia also finds el-Bârid, a place west of Jenin, as a quite plausible candidate on topographical grounds."}

Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Sir Lewis Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th-century British House of Commons, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed \"Namier Inc.\" Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, \"ordinary people\". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's pioneering work of microhistory, Montaillou (1975), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small Occitan village, the last pocket of Cathars, over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324.\n\nParagraph 3: Many modern trolleybuses are equipped with auxiliary propulsion systems, either using a small diesel engine or battery power, allowing movement away from the overhead wires, called \"off-wire\" movement, but such vehicles are generally not considered to be dual-mode buses if their off-wire capability is very limited.  Examples include the fleet of about 300 trolleybuses in San Francisco and the trolleybuses used on a 2005-opened system in Rome, Italy, which are capable of running on battery power only for short distances or short periods of time before needing recharging. The Rome vehicles are powered from overhead trolley wires over most of the 11.5-km route and only use battery power on the 500-metre section closest to the city centre. Dual mode trolleybuses in a number of Chinese cities can operate significant distances (8 to 10 km) off-wire on battery power.\n\nParagraph 4: Anderson's aptitude for journalism appeared at the early age of 12 when he began writing the Boy Scouts Column for The Deseret News. He published his first articles in his local newspaper, The Murray Eagle. He edited his high school newspaper, The Granitian. He joined The Salt Lake Tribune in 1940, where his muckraking exploits included infiltrating polygamous Mormon fundamentalist sects. In 1944, he joined the United States Merchant Marine and served on cargo ships that went to New Guinea and India. In the spring of 1945, he resigned from the Merchant Marine, and became a war correspondent stationed in Chungking, China. Shortly after World War II ended, he was drafted into the United States Army, and served until the fall of 1946 as an armed forces newsman and radio broadcaster. While in the Army, Anderson worked on the Shanghai edition of Stars and Stripes, produced by troops and XMHA, the Armed Forces' radio station. After his stint in the Army, Anderson was hired by Drew Pearson for the staff of his column, the \"Merry-Go-Round\". When Pearson died in 1969, Anderson inherited responsibility for this column and gave his own name to it – Washington Merry-go-Round. In its heyday, Anderson's column was the most influential and widely read in the U.S.; published in nearly a thousand newspapers, he reached an audience of 40 million people. He co-founded Citizens Against Government Waste with J. Peter Grace in 1984.\n\nParagraph 5: Despite the biggest opposition party - that headed the government from 2005 to 2021 - being socially conservative on the issues of LGBT rights (CDU/CSU), Germany has frequently been seen as one of the most gay-friendly countries in the world. Recent polls have indicated that a large majority of Germans support same-sex marriage. Another poll, conducted by the Pew Research Center, in 2013 indicated that 87% of Germans believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, which was the second highest score in the 39 countries polled, following Spain (88%). Berlin has been referred to by publications as one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world. Former Mayor of Berlin Klaus Wowereit is one of the most famous openly gay men in Germany, next to the former Mayor of Hamburg, Ole von Beust, the former Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, the deceased former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Vice-Chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, the former Federal Ministry of the Environment, Barbara Hendricks, comedians Hape Kerkeling, and Hella von Sinnen, or political journalist Anne Will. Founded in 1981, the Akademie Waldschlösschen, an adult education conference center near Göttingen, has developed into a national networking hub for LGBTI teachers, lawyers, clergy, gay fathers and gay and lesbian student groups at German universities. Other famous gay rights activists include Rosa von Praunheim, whose film It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives (1971) triggered the modern gay liberation movement in Germany.\n\nParagraph 6: On Friday, 9 January 2009 a long-planned education protest march took place in Athens. The rally was organized to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 murder of high school teacher Nikos Temponeras by the secretary of the Patras youth organization of the, back then, ruling New Democracy (Greece) party, participants said they protest against police repression, corrupt politicians, the education reform and a social system that offers little hope, it was one of two held in the capital but it was the only one that turned violent. The trouble began after the rally by several thousand schoolchildren, teachers and students had almost reached its end, near the entrance to University of Athens where it had started. When hooded youths broke away from the student march and threw stones and flares at riot police, who fired tear gas and flash grenades. The youths then turned on police, hurling rocks and flares. At one point a group of protesters tried to force their way into the rector's office and to occupy the central offices of the University of Athens. The occupation of the University's offices was obstructed by groups of students and academics. According to rector Christos Kittas, police officers did not ask for university immunity to be lifted so that they could gain access to the faculty. Clashes continued in the area which was closed to traffic and where hundreds of demonstrators remained for an hour. There were repeated police charges and several arrests were made. Some 60 persons were arrested with several demonstrators severely injured in clashes with police. Between those arrested were fourteen lawyers, who said that they had nothing to do with the protest, also several people sustained minor injuries and one was hospitalized. Afterwards the influential Journalists' Union of the Athens Daily Newspapers (ESIEA) protested to the Ministry for the Interior and Public Order about \"the brutal attacks and beatings\" to which reporters and camera crews had been subjected by some riot police units. \"There may have been excesses to be condemned, we are looking into the issue, but the police did their job,\" Minister for the Interior and Public Order Prokopis Pavlopoulos told Greek television. Later that evening, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the capital's central police headquarters on Alexandras Avenue, leading to some tense scuffles with officers. But the crowd had dispersed by late night, according to police who did not report any additional problems.\n\nParagraph 7: Major General John C. Breckinridge was commanding Confederate forces in the Department of Southwest Virginia during a critical time in the 1864 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. Although he did not want to use the VMI cadets in battle, Breckinridge requested that Smith send them to reinforce his outnumbered army when Union forces began to move into the valley. On May 12, 1864, Smith sent almost the entire Corps of Cadets of VMI, leaving behind only 27 cadets to guard the Institute, to help hold off the advance of the Union Army under Major General Franz Sigel from the northern end of the valley. Smith, who was ill, also stayed behind. The cadets were led by 24-year-old Commandant of Cadets and VMI teacher Scott Ship. On May 15, 1864, the VMI Cadets earned distinction and fame at the Battle of New Market as the only Corps of Cadets in United States history to fight as a unit in battle. Ten cadets were killed and forty-seven were wounded in their defense of the center of the Confederate line at a critical point in the battle. The Union forces were defeated and Sigel withdrew them to Mount Jackson and then to his headquarters at Cedar Creek, Virginia.\n\nParagraph 8: The condo unit owner and the building's developer may be liable for negligence that resulted in a gas leak that led to the May 31 deadly explosion at Two Serendra condominium in Taguig, Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas said Thursday. Citing the findings of the inter-agency task force and foreign experts that looked into the incident, Roxas said the leak in Unit 501-B was caused by the \"unauthorized movement of the gas range (which) caused a detachment of the gas supply hose.\" The explosion occurred when the leak was ignited by a light switch, he said. The tenant, one of four people who died as a result of the blast, was not alerted of the leakage because the \"vaporized\" LPG used in Serendra's pipeline system was odorless, Roxas added. That attitude of the Ayala Land developer and the cooking-gas supplier led to the blast that killed four people at the residential block Two Serendra in Taguig on May 31, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said on Thursday. The Ayala-owned Serendra Inc., in a statement issued Thursday, said that it had taken note of the findings of the interagency task force that investigated the explosion and that it remained “confident that government regulations and standards have been complied within the design and operation of Serendra.” Serendra Inc. promised to work with the government for the improvement of those standards and adhere to any changes in regulations. “Once again, we wish to express our regret over the incident. The conclusion of the IATF investigation will allow us to expedite the conduct of repairs and restoration of the damaged building so the affected residents can return to their units as the soonest possible time,” the company said. An explosion ripped through an apartment on the fifth floor of Two Serendra at 8:30 p.m. on May 31, blowing off an entire wall and sending it flying across the road below. The wall crashed on a passing delivery van of a prominent chain of appliance stores, killing the vehicle’s three occupants. Five others, including an American and a 9-year-old child, were injured. Angelito San Juan, the renter of the apartment who was vacationing from the United States, suffered serious burns and died in hospital a month later. The government investigation by the task force, led by Roxas, began on June 1. to continue, especially in this kind of sensitive matter [involving] the vaporized distribution system of gas,” Roxas said, as he presented the final findings of the task force at a news conference in Camp Crame on Thursday. Roxas reiterated the previous finding of the task force that the blast that destroyed Unit 501-B in Two Serendra was not caused by a bomb, but by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that leaked from the main gas supply line of the building. Justice for victims Roxas said the task force identified the possible liabilities in the explosion of Makati Development Corp. (MDC), the property developer of Two Serendra, and Bonifacio Gas Corp. (BGC), the supplier of LPG to the building. Both companies belong to the Ayala Corporation. Also facing possible charges are the owner and caretaker of Unit 501-B, officials of RM Larido Construction Services, which renovated the apartment, and Two Serendra Inc. Gas range moved Citing the final task force report, Roxas said investigators discovered that the workers of RM Larido Construction Services, with the consent of the owner, Marianne Cayton-Castillo, moved the gas range in Unit 501-B by 22.9 centimeters from its original position when they renovated the apartment. Roxas said the paint drippings on the hose of the gas range, which connects it to the main gas line, showed that the hose was lying on the floor when the explosion happened.\n\nParagraph 9: Vallengrove Park is a subdivision developed in 1961 between Wellesworth area and highway 27 by Vallen- Grove Developments. The three bedroom-one bath simple brick bungalows with garage on approx. fifty foot wide lots sold for approx. seventeen thousand dollars new. Their real estate value in 2011 sold from four hundred and seventy five thousand and up. By the year 2020, those same houses saw their market value increase to nine hundred thousand, and from one million to one million-two hundred thousand with modern renovations. It was marked in the early 1960s by a red brick entrance (West Deane still had its named entrance towards the Millennium) at the then connecting Birgitta Crescent, to the long-gone off entrance from the southbound service road of then Highway 27 (a farm house and barn stood there where today's off ramp is), and leading into the suburb between that west of 27 towards Wellesworth Park, and halfway north along Odessa Ave. and as far as Renforth Dr. That new area was built in 1961. The older area further north along Odessa and nearby streets, was built a few years earlier: wherever one sees the old wood hydro poles instead of concrete. Vallengrove Park was once farmland. Cows bones were found by children digging around before all areas were paved and settled, and another farm was at the location of the Catholic church - Nativity of Our Lord and was torn down at same time. Forty-one homes in the area were expropriated and moved to Bramalea when Highway 27 was expanded into the 427 in 1970. The nine and ten year old residences moved, were only the eastern most homes of Summerfield Crescent, and other nearby north-south streets with any home which happened to have back yards which were right behind the old service road, which became the sound barrier wall and hill.  (they are now located on Epsom Downs Drive). Part of their front lawns can be seen today at the sound barrier wall. Wellesworth Junior School was opened in 1960 when hundreds of tulips were given by the Netherlands for planting. Tulips are still grown there almost 50 years later. The area's high school was Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute. It closed in 1986 with a reunion there. The northernmost part of The West Mall (an important and very busy artery today) ended as a bumpy, dirt bicycle path a short distance south of its intersection at Rathburn. The south end of that unfinished part continued to the edge of Burnhamthorpe, where Percy Bishop built the new Etobicort Mall across from the Shaver/Bishop farm house - then directly at the corner of Burnhamthorpe and The West Mall. Mr. Bishop gave land to Etobicoke in order for the road to be opened up, and had it built, around 1964.\n\nParagraph 10: Goldring volunteered for the British Army in 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, but was discharged for medical reasons. Subsequently, he took a more critical attitude towards the war, from a socialist position. He joined the 1917 Club, the mixed gender Bohemian radical equivalent of a \"gentlemen's club\", at 4 Gerrard Street, Soho; the name celebrated the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. He moved to Dublin, Ireland, and married there his first wife, Betty Duncan; they had two children (the elder, Hugh, was killed as a soldier in World War II). While in Dublin, Goldring witnessed the funeral of the Irish Republican activist Thomas Ashe, which he later wrote about in his book A Stranger in Ireland. Goldring was a member of the National Council for Civil Liberties."}

Crops across half of Texas were damaged by the storm as it pressed inland, including the loss of all open cotton and most late-season corn and rice. Many partly grown cotton bolls failed to open due to bruising from the storm, and roughly a quarter of all field cotton was lost. However, open ranges and forage crops benefited from rainfall. Several interior cities reported damage from the hurricane. Property damage was relatively minor in Angleton, where winds peaked at . Minor structures, including awnings, barns, and outhouses, were damaged. The hurricane wrought extensive damage to Brazos County, with strong winds destroying the chimneys and windows of numerous homes; the ruined façades resulted in widespread flooding of homes. Small houses and thousands of trees were toppled, as well as a -high oil derrick. Awnings were pulled apart from storefronts throughout the Main Street area, and the county courthouse was badly damaged. Two halls and small buildings were damaged at Texas A&M University, amounting to a damage toll of $5,000–$10,000. The Bryan Weekly Eagle reported that the storm had \"no equal in the history of the county\". Widespread damage also occurred in Rockdale and Caldwell. At Rockdale, the winds caused leaks in almost every house and tore down power lines, while store awnings and a church steeple were blown away in Caldwell. Telegraph and train service were out in Rosenberg, where business signage, trees, and wires were blown down by strong winds; the city incurred a $3,000 damage toll. A church and warehouse in Elgin were destroyed. Seven other towns reported major cotton losses and minor property damage. Lockhart lost 75–80 percent of their cotton and many of their shade trees. The cotton crop was entirely destroyed in Bastrop, Hallettsvile, Sealy, Shiner, and Smithville. About 15–25 percent of cotton across Central Texas was damaged, amounting to several millions of dollars in losses. In Travis County, more cotton bolls were open compared to other areas prior to the storm, making the county susceptible to greater losses. All unharvested corn was blown down in Lexington. In Williamson County, the storm was more destructive than the 1900 hurricane, damaging outhouses, windmills, and buildings on the Southwestern University campus. The county also lost 15,000–20,000 bales of cotton. Heavy rains and winds of  were reported across the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n\nParagraph 2:  In March 2017, it was reported that Sony Pictures was developing a Black Cat and Silver Sable-centered film with writer Christopher Yost. It was intended to be a part of a shared universe called the Sony's Spider-Man Universe, which is centered on characters from the Spider-Man mythology and began with the live-action Venom in 2018. The film was to be more adult-oriented and though it would have taken place in the same reality as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they would have not crossed over with each other. In May 2017, it was announced that Gina Prince-Bythewood would direct the film, now titled Silver & Black. Production was to begin in March 2018, but the film was later delayed \"indefinitely\". Prince-Bythewood revealed that the cause of the delay was due to script issues. While the film was initially scheduled to be released on February 8, 2019, Sony removed the release date from the schedule. In August 2018, Sony announced that Silver & Black was canceled in favor of having both characters appear in their own feature films. Black Cat was reportedly a re-worked version of the Silver & Black script while the studio was searching for screenwriters for Silver Sable. Prince-Bythewood will serve as a producer on both projects. As of April 2020, the film is now believed to be cancelled in favour of the proposed live-action television series.\n\nParagraph 3: Eden Gardens State Park is a  Florida State Park and historic site located in Point Washington, south of Freeport, off U.S. 98 on CR 395, in northwestern Florida at 181 Eden Gardens Road (CR 395) in Santa Rosa Beach.  The park is centered on the Wesley House, a two-story mansion virtually surrounded by white columns and verandas. The house is notable for its furnishings, especially examples of late 18th century French furniture. The house was also used as the setting of the 1972 horror film Frogs. The Wesley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Eden Mansion on July 20, 2021. The site has various gardens, numerous large, old southern live oak trees, and frontage on Tucker Bayou.\n\nParagraph 4: Both Chou Wen-chung and Jean-Charles François have analyzed the structure and timbre features of Ionisation in detail. András Wilheim has noted that only the last 17 measures of Ionisation include musical tones of the \"traditional tonal system\", where any five successive chords contain the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. Holder writes, \"The reconceptualization of pitch was one of Varèse's great insights. He was able to reinvent the role of concert percussion in a radical and refreshing manner, primarily by establishing pitch relationships between instruments of individually indeterminate pitch... its performance is a reenactment of a great rite of passage for what was then a fresh and previously unrecognized musical ensemble.\"\n\nParagraph 5: Euthecodon was a large-bodied crocodilian with an elongated snout similar to that of extant gavialoids. Euthecodon differs from any other known longirostrine crocodilian in its deeply scalloped rostral margins, each tooth sitting in its own bony sheath, separated from the next by a notable constriction of the rostrum, given the skull a saw-like appearance when viewed from above. The first mandibular teeth occlude outside of the premaxilla and never pierce it as seen in some other crocodilians. The individual teeth are slender, isodont and pointed with two keels (bicarinate), clearly suited for a piscivorous diet. Tooth count varies greatly between species. E. arambourgi, the species with the shortest snout, possesses 19 tooth sockets housing 20 teeth in the upper jaw.  Ginsburg and Buffetaut assign 24 upper jaw teeth to E. nitriae and up to 27 for E. brumpti. The largest specimen from Lothagam possesses 21 teeth in the upper jaw and 20 in the lower, while some specimens from the Pliocene to Pleistocene of Kenya (Koobi Fora) preserve 24 to 25 maxillary teeth opposing 21 to 22 dentary teeth. This difference in tooth count has led some researchers to question whether these specimens, typically assigned to E. brumpti, might actually represent their own species. Unlike any other crocodilians, Euthecodon typically possess only four premaxillary teeth instead of five, with Euthecodon arambourgi as an exception, seemingly representing a transitional form in the process of losing the tooth. While still possessing five premaxillary teeth, the second is notably smaller than the rest and shares a single sheath with the third premaxillary tooth. The nasal bone bears a prominent ridge leading up to the eyes, giving its forehead a sloping appearance somewhat similar to that of Crocodylus checchiai. This form is maintained until the contact between maxilla and premaxilla, where the snout slightly slopes upwards and places the nares on a pedestal. Both the forehead boss and raised nares are most prominent in E. brumpti and far less developed in either E. nitriae or E. arambourgi. The nasals are always excluded from any contact to the nares by the premaxilla reaching far back in between the maxilla, meeting the nasal bone at the level of the sixth maxillary tooth. The nasal is fused in some specimens, while others retain it as two distinct bones with visible sutures. Both the prefrontal bones and lacrimal bones are long and splinter-shaped, with the lacrimals contacting the nasal bones towards the middle or anterior end of the \"boss\" depending on the specimen. Notably, the skull table of Euthecodon is comparably small and almost square in shape, with oval supratemporal fenestra (not circular as in gavialoids). Older individuals are known to develop noticeable squamosal ridges or \"horns\".\n\nParagraph 6: Through a piece of information given by the Tanjavur office, the CBI team track down a former employee of the local government, which Attipatti was under. He tells them to visit Lutheran Chapel's Father Louis, who knew every single person of Attipatti. In a visit to the Lutheran Chapel, Sarojini and her team meet Father Kuriakose who inform them that Father Louis had passed away 10 years ago, but left a box to be handed over to whichever government body that comes to the church and asks about Attipatti. After reading the letter in the box, Sarojini instructs digging near the coastal area where Attipatti once located. She and her team are horrified to find hundreds of dead bodies buried deep under. They are presumably the former inhabitants of Attipatti. Buried with them is also a tombstone bearing the names of all who perished. After a quick verification with the last census, they found out one name is missing in the tombstone, a five-year-old named Arivanandam. Father Kuriakose informs Sarojini, based on church records, a boy named Anthony was baptised on the same year the atrocity happened, and that he eventually went on to obtain Law degree. Sarojini concludes that Arivanandam and Anthony are the same person, and he is Citizen, and her further investigation leads her to Abdullah. With the CBI officers prepare to ambush Abdullah in a mosque, he manages to escape via a secret route. Sarojini discovers Citizen's secret operation room within the mosque. There she finds out Citizen's next target is DGP Devasagayam. However, at the same moment, Citizen had already kidnapped the DGP. The CBI officers receive information that Citizen is hiding in Tada forest and go after him. In the forest, Indhu comes to meet Abdullah and reveals she already knew he was Citizen some time ago and that she still likes him in spite of that. CBI officers arrive at the forest and, after some chase, finally manage to arrest the Citizen.\n\nParagraph 7: Dr. Chávez studied at Colegio de San Nicolás and the School of Medicine of Morelia. He received his bachelor's degree in medicine-surgery from the National University in 1920. He was the rector of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo from 1920 to 1921. He taught several subjects in the School of Medicine of Morelia (1920) and at the National School of Medicine since 1922. He specialized in cardiology in Paris (1921–1927) under Henri Vasquez and Charles Laubry. He was the head of the National School of Medicine (1933–1934). He visited clinics in Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Rome and Brussels to observe their operation and framework. He later founded the first Department of Cardiology within el Hospital General de Mexico (1924–1944). He was also the director of the General Hospital of Mexico (1936–1939). He was the founder and director (1944–1961) of the National Institute of Cardiology, the first hospital of this kind in Mexico, and then he is Director of the newly built Institute, for two and a half years again, starting in 1976. He was the rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (March 1965 to April 1966). He was instrumental in establishing international cooperation in cardiology after World War II. He founded and chaired the Mexican Society of Cardiology (1935) and the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (1946). Also in 1946, along with Paul Dudley White and Charles Laubry, he co-founded the International Society of Cardiology, an organization of which he was vice-chairman (1958–1962) and honorary life chairman (after 1962). He presided over the fourth World Congress of Cardiology held in Mexico City in 1962. He was a member of the counseling committee of the World Health Organization (1955) and the Organization of American States (1958–1966). He participated in 18 different cardiology societies in all America and Europe. He was appointed honorary doctor or rector of 95 universities around the world.\n\nParagraph 8: POD was published in 1997. It was one of the first games to support the MMX instruction set and came bundled as an OEM version with computers using Intel Pentium or Pentium II MMX processors, and some AMD K6 systems. The OEM 1.0 version did not support 3dfx cards or a network mode. A retail version of POD (called POD 2.0 by Ubisoft) was later released and featured more circuits and cars, plus support for 3dfx video cards and network play. A special multiplayer program called \"Game Service\" was provided by Ubisoft for POD players so that they could race on Ubisoft servers. POD was among the first games optimized for video cards with a 3dfx chipset using the Glide API. Only video cards with the 3dfx Voodoo 1 chipset were supported upon the game's release. Ubisoft later published patches, which added support for the Voodoo 2 using the Glide API and non-3dfx chipsets via Direct3D. Less than a year after publishing POD, Ubisoft issued an expansion pack under the title Back to Hell (also known as Extended Time in France) in late 1997. This pack contained 19 circuits and 15 new vehicles, including motorcycles, a floating purple batlike creature, and a witch riding a broom. Another version called POD: Gold was later released, which included POD, its expansion, plus a new sound set.\n\nParagraph 9: Wong-Chu once served as a commander for the Vietnamese congress during the Vietnam War. At the start of the story, he was shown offering to free the village if he could be beaten in wrestling. When a reckless American contingent triggered a booby trap in the Vietnamese jungles while testing a new weapon, one of Wong-Chu's commanders found a survivor in the form of Tony Stark. Wong-Chu reviewed the unconscious civilian's papers and learned that Stark was a famous weapons inventor. Wong-Chu's assistant Hsaio informed him that the shrapnel in Stark's heart should kill him within the week. Wong-Chu tried to capitalize on this by telling Stark that he was dying and that, if he created a powerful new weapon for him, then his surgeons would save him. Stark realized that Wong-Chu was lying, thinking that if they could have removed the shrapnel then they would have done it then so that Stark might live long enough to continue to develop weapons for them. Hoping that his last act would be to defeat Wong-Chu, Stark pretended to agree. Wong-Chu then supplied whatever tools and scrap iron Stark might require, and eventually lent the American the assistance of his own manservant, Ho Yinsen, a once highly respected and brilliant Nobel laureate physicist. Tony and Yinsen needed six days to complete the weapon Stark was building, the first suit of Iron Man's armor. On the seventh day, the two finished the Iron Man armor just as Stark's condition became critical, and he could no longer stand. Stark was no sooner outfitted in his new armor for the first time and beginning to recharge it than the alarm they had installed earlier in the week went off, warning them that Wong-Chu was approaching. Yinsen ran outside, distracting the guards long enough to give Iron Man time to charge his armor. Wong-Chu killed Yinsen as Iron Man finished charging his armor, but failed to notice that Stark was in the Iron Man armor, and hiding on the ceiling. Unable to find Stark, Wong-Chu had Hsaio prepare his favorite sport, which involved wrestling with the local peasants. After defeating a peasant, Wong-Chu demanded the next challenger, and a man in heavy clothing challenged him. To his dismay, the next challenger ended up being Stark in the Iron Man armor who ended up defeating Wong-Chu. After small arms fire failed to kill Iron Man, who used a crude repulsor mechanism to turn away heavy artillery, Wong-Chu made an attempt to call for backup over the loudspeaker in a nearby observation tower. This failed because Iron Man interfered with it and instead sent out a message for the guards to flee. Wong-Chu then tried to escape Iron Man and kill the prisoners. But instead, he was killed in an ammo dump explosion that Iron Man caused.\n\nParagraph 10: Hay also served in the War of 1812 between Britain and America, and commanded the 100th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Chippawa in July 1814. As the redcoats of the 1/1st (Royal Scots) Foot and 100th Regiments moved forward, their own artillery had to stop firing in order to avoid hitting them. Meanwhile, the American gunners switched from firing roundshot to firing canister, with lethal consequences for the British infantry. Once the opposing lines had closed to less than 100 yards apart, General Winfield Scott of the United States Army advanced his wings, forming his brigade into a \"U\" shape which allowed his flanking units to catch the British advancing troops in a heavy crossfire. Hay made an attempt to fight to the death but was taken prisoner of war by the Americans. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1815. After the War he returned to Scotland and improved his family estate at Yester. From 1818 to 1820 he served as Pro-Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. He was elected a representative peer for Scotland in July 1818, appointed Knight of the Thistle in 1820 and became Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian in February 1823. He was also promoted to colonel on 27 May 1825 and to major-general on 10 May 1837. Meanwhile, on his estate, he developed an improved method of making tiles for draining which was patented in October 1839."}

Starting in the 1950s, fossil fuel companies, such as the American Petroleum Institute and Marcellus Shale Coalition, engaged in lobbying efforts against nuclear power due to perceived threats to their commercial interests. In recent years, large fossil fuel suppliers have launched advertising campaigns presenting fossil gas as a complementary energy source to renewables.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has also supported environmental organizations with anti-nuclear positions, including donating to Friends of the Earth. Some environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Fund, have received grants from fossil fuel companies. Greenpeace previously advocated for the gradual replacement of nuclear power with fossil gas plants as a backup to renewable energy, but it has since shifted its stance towards grid energy storage.\n\nIn Germany, the Energiewende initiative, which aimed to transition to renewable energy, resulted in a gradual phaseout of nuclear power from 2000 to 2022. However, this led to an increase in fossil gas power production, with imports from Russia playing a significant role. Controversial pipeline projects, like Nord Stream 1, were constructed to meet the growing demand for Russian gas in Germany.

Cottrol reviewed The Myth of Race favorably, writing, \"With The Myth of Race, Robert Sussman gives us a comprehensive history of the idea of race and particularly the rise and not total fall of scientific racism\". Ruth C. Engs was less favorable in her review of the book, writing that \"...rarely does [Sussman] compare the interpretation of one historian with that of another in an objective manner or compare interpretations from one time period to those from another, as other historiographical researchers usually do. Researchers in the past, or present, who do not agree with his conclusions are considered “racists” or part of “the eugenics bigot brigade.”\" She concludes that \"Sussman’s lack of objectivity in this book is disconcerting. For those looking for a work that summarizes the negative side of the hereditarian and eugenics movements, however, this book would be an adequate reference. Also in its favor is its extensive bibliography of contemporary and older works.\" In a mixed review, Kathleen Feyh wrote that \"Sussman's book is an elegant genealogy of the myth of race from the Spanish Inquisition through the twentieth-century eugenics movement and its demystifiers among those who study human differentiation.\" She also criticized the book by writing that Sussman's \"...analysis is limited in no small part by his method, which confines him to a history of racist ideas and ideologues rather than one of how racist ideas function in society, leaving the reader with a very well-written debate within the field of anthropology rather than achieving one of his stated goals, namely \"to further...understanding of why racism is still so prevalent in our society\"\". In a generally favorable review, Jeffrey C. Long wrote that \"The Myth of Race rightly points to a critical role for Franz Boas, who formulated anthropology along non‐racial lines, even before biological anthropology adopted the evolutionary principles established by the New Synthesis in the 1930s. This is an important contribution of the book. It clearly establishes that racists and eugenicists in the last century chose their ideologies over superior alternatives.\" In comparing The Myth of Race with Michael Yudell's book Race Unmasked, Nathaniel C. Comfort wrote that \"The eugenics movement - particularly in the United States in the early twentieth century and in Nazi Germany - offers a cornucopia of evidence of scientific racism. But, in focusing on the US movement's most egregious leaders, such as Charles Davenport, Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn, both Yudell and Sussman over-simplify. Eugenics was about much more than just race.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Schiff migrated to the United States after the American Civil War and joined the firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co. From his base on Wall Street, he was the foremost Jewish leader from 1880 to 1920 in what later became known as the \"Schiff era\", grappling with all major Jewish issues and problems of the day, including the plight of Russian Jews under the Tsar, American and international anti-semitism, care of needy Jewish immigrants, and the rise of Zionism. He also became a director of many important corporations, including the National City Bank of New York, Equitable Life Assurance Society, Wells Fargo & Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad. In many of his interests he was associated with E. H. Harriman.\n\nParagraph 4: The fossil fuel industry starting from the 1950s was engaging in campaigns against the nuclear industry which it perceived as a threat to their commercial interests. Organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association and Marcellus Shale Coalition were engaged in anti-nuclear lobbying in the late 2010s and from 2019, large fossil fuel suppliers started advertising campaigns portraying fossil gas as a \"perfect partner for renewables\" (wording from Shell and Statoil advertisements). Fossil fuel companies such as Atlantic Richfield were also donors to environmental organizations with clear anti-nuclear stances, such as Friends of the Earth. Groups like the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council are receiving grants from other fossil fuel companies. As of 2011, a strategy paper released by Greenpeace titled \"Battle of Grids\" proposed gradual replacement of nuclear power by fossil gas plants which would provide \"flexible backup for wind and solar power\". However, Greenpeace has since distanced itself from advocating for fossil gas, instead proposing grid energy storage as a solution to issues caused by intermittent renewable energy. In Germany the Energiewende, which was advertised as a shift to renewable energy but included a gradual phaseout of nuclear power from 2000 to end 2022, caused among other things a rise in fossil gas power production from 49.2 TWh in 2000 to 94.7 TWh in 2020. In the same interval total electricity generation barely changed (576.6 TWh in 2000 vs 574.2 TWh in 2020) while it did rise and fall in the meantime, reaching a peak of 652.9 TWh in 2017. As much of that fossil gas was and is imported from Russia, controversial pipeline projects like Nord Stream 1 were built to satisfy increasing German gas demand. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine it came to light that significant amounts of Russian lobbying was involved in both the continued anti-nuclear movement in Germany and the anti-fracking movement.\n\nParagraph 5: Squires and Kennison's thesis was that there is no coordinated approach to the development of police firearms policy in Britain, and that the response Waldorf's shooting was an example of the British police's event-driven policy making. They noted that the reforms emanating from the Dear Report did not prevent similar incidents, and believed that \"each incident exposed failings at several levels of police critical incident management and execution\". In 1986, the Home Office established another working group to build on the Dear Report, following two more mistaken police shootings—those of Cherry Groce, which sparked the 1985 Brixton riot, and John Shorthouse a five-year-old boy accidentally shot dead in Birmingham. Peter Waddington, a sociologist specialising in police policy on the use of force, suggested that these incidents, taken together with Waldorf's shooting, caused a permanent shift in the public's perception of armed policing and that police shootings—even of armed criminals and where police procedure had been followed correctly—became much more controversial from then on. The report endorsed Dear's recommendations on training and selection of AFOs. Its main recommendation was that police forces place greater emphasis on specialist teams of armed officers, such as the Met's D11, and concentrate the use of firearms on a smaller, but better-trained, group of officers. It also suggested research into roving armed patrols, which in the 1990s became armed response vehicles, and recommended that local detectives (as Finch was) should no longer be AFOs; members of central squads (such as C11 or the Flying Squad) would be the only plainclothes officers to hold AFO status. As a result of these reforms, the number of AFOs in the Met reduced by about almost half over the following decade. Many of the report's other findings were overtaken by the 1987 Hungerford massacre, which prompted further reforms to armed policing. In a 2023 book chapter, Squires argued that the effects of Waldorf's shooting continued to be felt and that the lessons from it and other incidents remained relevant.\n\nParagraph 6: The Sandinista Renovator Movement (MRS) party condemned the recent attacks against the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, such as the burning of the Chapel of the Blood of Christ in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Managua this Friday morning, “We absolutely condemn all terrorist attacks and vandalism against temples and churches, now against the Cathedral of Managua, which constitute a flagrant violation of religious freedom, enshrined in the Nicaraguan Constitution ” For his part, José Adán Aguerri, President of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, expressed his solidarity through his Twitter account for this act of terrorism that occurred in the Cathedral of Managua “from COSEP Nicaragua and personally, our solidarity and support for the archdiocese. of Managua and the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference, before the cowardly attack on the Cathedral of Managua that adds to the acts of vandalism in different chapels in the country in previous days. Intolerance will not succeed, ”says the publication. Opposition coalition Blue and White National Unity (UNAB) condemned the acts of desecration, siege and harassment against the Catholic Church in Nicaragua and ensure that \"these acts violate freedom of religion provided for in our Constitution. These events, in addition to being targeted attacks, demonstrate the levels of insecurity experienced by the population at the national level. ” He also added that \"the evidence shows that the attacks are being committed by people related to the criminal dictatorship of Daniel Ortega, who maintains a permanent political campaign against priests and the Church. We stand in solidarity with the Catholic Church and the devout and Christian people of our country, in the face of such acts of desecration, ”the UNAB statement continues. The Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH) through a statement expressed its repudiation of what happened in the Chapel of the Blood of Christ of the Cathedral of Managua, burned by an unknown person who threw a Molotov bomb and then fled the scene without leaving trail. \"We demand that the authorities INVESTIGATE THE FACTS WITH CELERITY AND FIND THE GUILTY, otherwise we will suppose that it was the Ortega Murillo regime who gave the order to burn down the temple to continue its campaign of hatred and terror against churches, religious and believers that adversity him \"expresses part of the Communiqué. Juan Sebastian Chamorro member of the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy condemned the facts in a video via the social network Twitter and Father Edwin Roman condemned the attack and indicated that it can burn and destroy the image of the Lord but never Faith and dignity from his people. In this regard, the auxiliary bishop of Managua, Silvio Báez, wrote on his Twitter account: \"We have cried together because of the fire that has occurred in the chapel of the venerated image of the Blood of Christ.\" \"Terrorist act associated with paramilitaries of the regime burn down the chapel of the Blood of Christ,\" denounced the opposition Edipcia Dubón. \"I urge your Holiness the Pope to denounce the attacks by Daniel Ortega and his paramilitaries against the Catholic Church, the bishops and priests and the terrorist acts against the Cathedral of Managua,\" demanded activist Bianca Jagger. The Evangelical Alliance of Nicaragua, the main organization of evangelical Christians in the Central American country, has rejected the attack on the Chapel of the Blood of Christ located in the Cathedral of Managua.\n\nParagraph 7: Lief, Barda, and Jasmine had retrieved the emerald from Dread Mountain. They travel along the River Tor to get to the Maze of the Beast, where they will get the amethyst. The gems they are taking are part of a Belt of Deltora, which will defeat the Shadow Lord that has invaded Deltora. During their travel, they encounter a pair of children nearly drowning in a stream. They save the children, but they reveal themselves to be Ols, creatures created by the Shadow Lord that can transform themselves to become another living creature. These creatures overrun the west side of Deltora to keep the gems hidden. Just before Barda is about to die, a boy Dain attacks the Ols and saves them. In the process, Dain injures his arm and several ribs. This causes Lief to sympathize for the boy, and take him to the Resistance, a group of people who rebel against the Shadow Lord. Arriving at the entrance to the Resistance's hideout, Dain faints from the pressure and forces the three to guess the password before they are marked as Ols and killed. Lief finds a note and realizes that the password is the first letter of every word on the note. They enter the Resistance and Doom, a man they have encountered before, tests them by putting them in a prison for three days. The test is supposed to find out if they are Ols because Ols can only hold their shape for three days. As three days pass, Doom does not let up and keeps them imprisoned. Dain frees them from the cave in exchange for their agreeing to take him to Tora. When Lief, Barda, and Jasmine reveal that they are not going to Tora, they split apart to make them less recognizable. Lief, Dain, and Barda take a boat that takes them down the river to the Maze of the Beast. They realize that Jasmine was also on the boat. The boat is raided by pirates, and Dain is taken prisoner. After reaching the Maze, Barda is revealed to be an Ol by the real Barda. Unfortunately, they are captured by pirates and are dumped into the Maze. After finding the location of the gem, Barda and Jasmine separate from Lief to lead the Beast away and Lief stays to carve the gem out of a column. They regroup when Lief was done, and escape the cave through a blowhole. The blowhole blows just after they escape, which takes the life of two pirates. The three then start off their journey to the Valley of the Lost.\n\nParagraph 8: The show featured two teams of three players in a charades competition: the Challenger Team was composed of a contestant joined with two guest star players, while the Home Team consisted of series regulars Jack Duffy, Dinah Christie and Billy Van. Using game play similar to the American game show Pantomime Quiz, answers were usually jokes or complex phrases involving a pun or some other form of word play (example: \"Tiny Tee Hee.... \"I didn't raise my daughter to be fiddled with,\" said the pussycat as she rescued her offspring from the violin factory\"). Viewers at home were also invited to send their own joke or phrase, which if used, could win them a small prize.\n\nParagraph 9: Tegetthoff was born in Marburg, Styria in the Austrian Empire (now Maribor, Slovenia), on 23 December 1827. He was the son of Karl von Tegetthoff, an Oberstleutnant in the Austrian Army. On his mother's side he was related to Johann Kaspar Freiherr von Seiller, mayor of Vienna from 1851 to 1861. Entering the Marinecollegium (naval academy) in Venice in 1840, Tegetthoff became a Seekadett on 23 July 1845 and witnessed the Venetian uprising in 1848/49. He received a commission upon his graduation on 16 April 1849 and took part in the blockade of Venice from May to August 1849. Tegetthoff was promoted to Fregattenleutnant on 16 June 1851 and Linienschiffsleutnant on 16 November 1852.\n\nParagraph 10: In its heyday, Dalymount Park, or \"Dalyer\" as it is popularly known, regularly saw crowds of up to 40,000 for big games, however, whether it was ever able to accommodate this number of spectators safely is open to question. The stadium consisted of three sides of open terracing, one side the \"Shed End\" or \"School End\" being partly covered with a roof over half the terrace since 1945. The fourth side was the main stand, which held only 1500 seats. The stand was constructed in 1928 from iron and wood, with wooden benches and terraced standing room at the front. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park once thought to have stood at Arsenal's old stadium, were in fact built in Scotland. The lights were funded through what we would now refer to as crowd funding and inviting some of the bigger teams over. Initial notices suggested that the lights would be in place by September 1961, which was then extended to October and ultimately until February of 1962. In the words of Club Secretary Andy Kettle, as quoted by Ryan Clarke in his recent series on Dalymount, it also meant that Bohs could “invite many top clubs to Dublin from time to time”."}

After moving to Los Angeles in 1986, she began appearing in episodes of prime time shows such as The Colbys, Falcon Crest, 227, China Beach, A Different World, and L.A. Law. She made her film debut on Number One with a Bullet (1987), before supporting role of Eddie Murphy's character's arranged wife in the 1988 comedy Coming to America. In 1990, she co-starred alongside Joe Morton in the ABC drama series, Equal Justice. During the 1990s, she had number of supporting roles in films, including What's Love Got to Do with It (1993) opposite Angela Bassett, The Inkwell (1994), and Crimson Tide (1995) as Denzel Washington's character wife. She also voiced a leading role in the 1992 dystopian animated film, Bébé's Kids. She had number of leading and supporting roles in the made for television movies. In 1995, she co-starred opposite James Earl Jones and former co-star Joe Morton in the short-lived CBS prime time soap opera, Under One Roof, the first drama series that feature an African-American lead characters.

She also had the leading roles on the short-leved NBC sitcom Rhythm & Blues (1992–93), and starred alongside Larry Hagman as his girlfriend in the CBS drama Orleans (1997).\n\nParagraph 3: Crows and Cranes, also known as Black and Blue, is an early 20th century team game brought from England to the States by American soldiers. It was described in November 1918 in The Youth's Companion magazine. Its roots go back to a German combat game called Day and Night or Black and White, published in 1796 by J. C. F. GutsMuths, which in turn is based on the ancient Greek game of Ostracinda.In the middle of the playground two groups of players of equal numbers are formed in parallel lines about one yard apart. A player, chosen as instructor, designates one line as the \"Crows\" and the other as the \"Cranes\". All players stand facing the instructor, who takes his place apart from the game (e. g. about two yards from one end of the lines). The goals are located thirty feet back of each line. The instructor starts the game by calling (and drawling) the consonants of each group's name: \"K – r – r – r – r...\", and then suddenly runs it off into either \"Crows!\" or \"Cranes!\". The aim of the game is to think ahead and react immediately to the possible situation of being the chaser or being chased. The players of one group, whose name the instructor calls, turn quickly and run towards their goal while the other players cross over the middle of the playground and chase them, tagging as many as possible. Those tagged must join the opposite group (in another variant they have to leave the game). The instructor can switch the call while the chasing process to reverse the action. If the Crows were chasing the Cranes and the instructor calls \"Crows!\", all the players must switch roles and directions. After the first round the players go back to the starting point and build new lines. The game continues until one group is successful by retaining a larger number of players at a given time.\n\nParagraph 4: Following the action-romance flick Thirumalai in 2003, Ghilli, a film directed by S. Dharani and produced by A. M. Rathnam, was released. It co-starred Trisha and Prakash Raj with Vijay as the lead. Ghilli was the first Tamil film of all time to gross over 500 million, or 50 crore, in the domestic box office.  The film grossed nearly $500,000 in the Malaysian market. Ghilli also broke the record for the most people seeing a movie in the first week of its release, previously held by M. G. Ramachandran's Adimai Penn (1969). Ghilli received favourable reviews. The Hindu stated that \"Vijay, the hero whom the masses today identify with, and Prakash Raj, the inimitable villain in tow, this flick, \"Ghilli\"...on a winning track\".\n\nParagraph 5: After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Rowley wrote a paper for FBI Director Robert Mueller documenting how FBI HQ personnel in Washington, D.C., had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the Minneapolis, Minnesota, Field Office regarding its investigation of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui had been suspected of being involved in preparations for a suicide-hijacking similar to the December 1994 \"Eiffel Tower\" hijacking of Air France 8969. Failures identified by Rowley may have left the U.S. vulnerable to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rowley was one of many agents frustrated by the events that led up to the attacks, writing:During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre–September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was \"Why?—Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case?\" (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this, but jokes were actually made that the key FBI HQ personnel had to be spies or moles like Robert Hanssen who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis's effort.)Coleen Rowley APFN.org  Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Jay Leno, formerly the host of NBC's long-running The Tonight Show franchise, had moved his show to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time, ahead of the local newscasts on most stations in a time slot that competes with CBS's and ABC's prime time programming (though Fox affiliates would have cut to post-primetime news or syndicated sitcom reruns by this time). Beginning in September 2009, Leno hosted The Jay Leno Show, which was mostly similar to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno with a few adjustments. This made way for Conan O'Brien (formerly the host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, another long-running NBC late night franchise) to take over The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, while Jimmy Fallon has assumed hosting duties for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The remaining late night programs (Poker After Dark and Last Call with Carson Daly) remained as is, and NBC warned its affiliates not to preempt or delay Leno for local news. After affiliates' fears of significantly lower ratings for local news were in fact realized, NBC announced it would indeed cancel its 10:00 p.m. experiment and move Leno back to his traditional start time of 11:35 (originally by moving The Jay Leno Show, before rejoining as host of The Tonight Show outright due to problems over the network's original plan to shift the latter program later by a half-hour to make room for Leno that led O'Brien to negotiate an exit from his Tonight contract).\n\nParagraph 7: During late 2007 and early 2008, as many of the residents of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps started to return to their home areas following peace talks, an outbreak of Hepatitis E engulfed the community, and soon spread to the entire district. As of August 2008, a total of 8,157 cases had been identified; 62% were female, while 38% were male. The case fatality ratio was 1.52%. Seventy two percent (72%) of the fatalities were female. The epidemic has been traced to unsanitary sources of drinking water. By July 2009, the number of infected persons had increased to 10,243, of whom 162 died; a case fatality ratio of 1.58%.\n\nParagraph 8: In winter, the location of the North Pacific Current bifurcation is approximately 45°N, which is 5° south of where it bifurcates in the summer at  approximately 50°N. This has implications as to what water is moved into the Alaskan subpolar gyre. In winter, when the splitting of the current is more south, fresh, warmer waters from river input from the Columbia (47°N) and Fraser (49°N) rivers are transported north. This shift in the North Pacific current location leads to winter currents transporting relatively warmer water poleward from a lower latitude than in the summer. Although the northern branch of the subtropical gyre shifts south in the winter, the subpolar gyre does not shift location, but intensifies in its circulation. This intensification brings a greater volume of water from the south into the subpolar gyre, which again is dependent on the magnitude of atmospheric circulation. For example: the Aleutian Low is a persistent low pressure system over the Gulf of Alaska that can fluctuate on decadal timescales, producing the PDO. If this system is relatively strong during winter, there will be an increase in northward transport of waters along the Alaskan current from southerly winds. Haida eddies have been documented to form predominantly in the winter when bifurcation is south, and favorable atmospheric conditions are met to intensify the subpolar gyre. With these conditions, Haida eddy formation has also been documented to occur from baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals, equatorial Kelvin waves, and bottom topography. Baroclinic instabilities form when tilting or sloping of isopycnals (horizontal lines of constant density) form. Baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals occur when a persistent wind along the coast changes direction. For example: in the Gulf of Alaska average winds travel from the south, poleward (termed southerly winds), but during a wind reversal the winds will abruptly shift to a northwesterly wind (coming from the northwest), and the coastal current that was being pushed north will now be pushed south. This change in direction causes rotation in an originally northward flowing current, which results in tilting isopyncals. Kelvin waves that form along the equator are able to travel along the west coast of North America to the Gulf of Alaska, where their presence can cause disruptions in the poleward current and form baroclinic instabilities. Bottom topography, the third formation process of Haida eddies, can occur because the Alaska current will interact with hills or rock formations below the surface, and this can cause baroclinic instabilities.\n\nParagraph 9: On July 2, 1879, workmen widening a carriage road near the Taughannock House Hotel uncovered what appeared to be the petrified body of a seven-foot-tall man. Newspapers reported on the find, and Cornell University scientists removed parts of the body for examination. Over 5,000 people paid a small admission fee to view the 800-pound \"giant.\" Before long, the figure was revealed to be a hoax created by the hotel's owner, John Thompson, and two associates. The idea for the hoax had been inspired by the Cardiff Giant, a similar \"discovery\" in nearby Cardiff, New York in 1869. Although the original giant has been damaged and lost, a replica was constructed for the Tompkins Center for History & Culture by local artists in 2019.\n\nParagraph 10: Following their breakaway, George of Poděbrady secretly supported their invasion into the Comitatus of Nitra and their occupation of the fort of Kosztolány, as the army was composed of Bohemian-Moravian professionals previously in service for George and Frederick III. Apart from the militia, there were religious outcasts (considered heretics) looking for shelter, including Hussite Bratriks (\"Brothers\" – Hussites in Slovakia/Upper Hungary) and rogue Žebraks who favoured pillaging instead of payment. Svehla established an ad hoc fort, and he appointed Jorig Lichtenburger and Vöttau as comeses for the county. The fort and its looting inhabitants had a surrounding sphere of influence ranging from the valleys of Váh and Nitra to the eastern provinces of Austria. Matthias realized the threat and ordered two of his \"upper-land\" captains to besiege Kosztolany, namely Stephen Zápolya and Ladislaus Podmaniczky. After returning from Slavonia, the king joined the siege. It is worth mentioning that here, among few occasions, Matthias cooperated with Frederick. He sent a strong-armoured mounted troop led by commander Ulrich von Grafeneck to help wipe out these brigades. When he reached Pozsony (Bratislava), he was reinforced by Knight Georg Pottendorfer with his 600 crusader cavalry. This totaled 8–10 thousand people ready to besiege, who began an assault after taking some minor fortifications on 1 January 1467. The vanguards of the Black Army officers were all present against their former ally. They included the Palatine Michael Ország, Jan Jiskra, Jan Haugwitz, Balázs Magyar, Pál Kinizsi, Nicholaus Ujlaki Ban of Macsó (Mačva), and Peter Sobi Ban of Bosnia-Croatia-Dalmatia, with the latter-most dying in the assault. Before the siege began, Matthias offered Švehla the chance to return to his service in exchange for an unconditional surrender on all grounds. After a refusal, he immediately began the siege and the cannon firing despite the harsh winter conditions. Švehla and his 2,500 men (and additional citizens) resisted the superior besiegers, but food storages reached extremely low levels and all the efforts to break out were unsuccessful, so he decided to capitulate twice to Matthias with the aforementioned taking his revenge in rejecting it. After three weeks, Švehla feigned a breakout attempt in the front while getting out from the rear through a water channel. Though his physically weak and exhausted entourage of 2,000 infantry tried to elude the besieging forces, they were not fast enough to escape safely. Balázs Magyar and Pál Kinizsi rode down to the fort of Csejte (Čachtice), where they clashed. Almost all of the rioters fell, only 250 taken as prisoners. Svehla evaded capture again but was put in custody by peasants by the time he was too debilitated to fight."}

A secret pact called the Mutual Pact of Succession was signed in 1703, stating that if both brothers died without male heirs, the daughters of the elder brother would take precedence over the daughters of the younger brother. The surviving sisters would also be heiresses. This pact was known only to a few individuals, including Leopold I and his sons. Eleonore and Wilhelmine were aware of its existence and worked to establish a public succession order. In 1712, Wilhelmine persuaded Count Seilern to give her the document, which she sent to her family's head. They then sought assistance from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz to negotiate with Charles VI. Eventually, Charles VI recognized the secret succession order in April 1713.

This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakbʼajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakbʼajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Chʼol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real (\"Royal Road\") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué.

Albeau's 49.09 knot record was set in winds of 45 to 50 knots, while the Yellow Pages Endeavour, which held a record of 46.52 knots from 1993 to 2004, was optimized to sail in a 19 knot wind.  Venue has much to do with the windsurfer's success, as all windsurfing 500m records since 1988 have been made at the same canal. Zara Davis holds the outright nautical mile record for a woman. Set in Walvis Bay Namibia an open water venue in November 2006 previous record was held by Valerie Ghibaudo of France\n\nParagraph 4: WOFL became one of the Fox Broadcasting Company's charter affiliates at the network's inception on October 9, 1986. However, it still essentially programmed itself as an independent in the network's first few years because, until April 1987, Fox carried only one program (The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers). The station was frequently ranked as one of the country's leading Fox affiliates during the network's early years, achieving a number one ranking on several occasions through the early 1990s. It was also the most profitable station in Meredith's station group, despite being its only UHF \"independent\" station at that time. As the 1990s progressed, WOFL offered fewer movies and older shows, and more talk, reality and court shows. As with most Fox stations, WOFL carried children's programming including those from the network's Fox Kids block. Despite having competing independents, WOFL was one of the last remaining Fox affiliates in a major market to retain broadcasting rights to most cartoons syndicated by Disney throughout the 1990s; while this left Orlando without an official Disney Afternoon lineup (due to Fox Kids competing for those same timeframes in most markets), the station still aired all of the lineup, though out of pattern in other timeslots.\n\nParagraph 5: Over the last 150, Arcade Creeks hydrology has changed drastically. Due to infrastructure building, peak flow has increased in volume while the construction of drainage systems and loss of land have decreased volume of depression storage. Both these two factors have caused an increase in peak flows as well as higher scour capacity. In the early years, the creek would run dry in some sections but starting about 45 years ago and due to urbanization, the stream flows perennially. During the summer months low flows run about 2 cubic feet per second (cfs), while the average base flows from between 15 and 20 cfs. During pea flows of intense storm systems, it can be as high or higher than 2,800 cfs. Arcade Creek is prone to flooding due to levees on both sides of the stream between Marysville blvd. and adjoining of Steelhead Creek in addition to constriction of channel flow due to road structures. Because of this during heavy storms and large amounts of precipitation, the golf course northeast and the residential area southeast are prone to flooding. Flooding stage gets reported via automatic sensors located at Scott Road and Deer Creek Crossing. CEQA-mandated a need to implement flood control in which the City of Citrus Heights approved a development plan that would provide three basins with a total of 20 acres that would receive and collect any storm water that spills over the creeks banks. Arcade Creeks groundwater is shallow, about 8 to 15 feet deep in depth, but due to being deeply incised from high flows this shallow groundwater lost. In addition, due to the fact that Arcade Creek has a large volume of urban runoff and drainage into the creek, it is filled with toxic pollutants, fertilizers, bacteria, metals, pesticides, soap, grease, fats, oil and other hydrocarbons. Arcade Creek also experiences high volume of litter and trash due to being surrounded by residential and commercial buildings. For the past 10 years, the USGS and Sacramento River Watershed Program have been monitoring Arcade Creeks water quality. It was found that the dissolved oxygen levels were among the lowest, while containing some of the highest contaminant concentration among the bodies of water tested. In 2001, SRWP determined that Arcade Creek ranked #7 in highest concentration of mercury, while having the highest levels of dissolved copper (4.0 ug/L), highest concentration of Zinc, fourth highest in copper, and third highest in arsenic contamination. In addition, Arcade Creek was found to have the highest number diazinon, chloropyrifos, prometon, and prowl which are strong pesticides. Because Arcade Creek flows into the Sacramento River, which leads to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and is used as drinking water for over 20 million people toxicity is a major concern.\n\nParagraph 6: Sources describing Silesia of the 9th and 10th centuries, such as the Bavarian Geographer () or Thietmar's Chronicle, indicate that the area which later became known as Silesia, was back then inhabited by several Lechitic tribes, known from written sources under their Latinised names. The Sleenzane (Slenzans; Ślężanie) lived in lands near modern Wrocław and along the Ślęza river, as well as near mount Ślęża. They probably numbered 60–75,000 people and according to the Bavarian Geographer, they were divided into 15 civitates. The Opolini (Opolans; Opolanie) lived in lands near modern Opole, their population was perhaps 30–40,000 and comprised 20 civitates. The Dadodesani or Dedosize (Dyadosans; Dziadoszanie) lived in areas near modern Głogów, numbered probably 30,000 people, as well as 20 civitates. The Golensizi (Golensizians; Golęszyce) dwelled near modern Racibórz, Cieszyn and Opawa - they consisted of five civitates. The Lupiglaa (Głubczyce) probably lived on the Głubczyce Plateau, near Głubczyce, and comprised 30 civitates. The Trebouane (Tryebovians; Trzebowianie), mentioned by the Prague Document (which describes the situation as of year 973 or earlier), occupied areas near modern Legnica and could number some 25–30,000 individuals. The Poborane (Bobrans; Bobrzanie) - mentioned by the same document - lived along the lower and middle course of the Bóbr river. The Psyovians (Psouane; Pszowianie) lived near Pszów, to the east of the Opolans and to the west of Cracow.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1720, the Dutch East India Company built a fort and factory called Lijdzaamheid (Lydsaamheid) on the spot of Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), since April 1721 governed by an Opperhoofd (chief factor), under authority of the Dutch Cape Colony, interrupted by Taylor's pirate occupation from April 1722 to 28 August 1722; in December 1730 the settlement was abandoned. Thereafter the Portuguese had—intermittently—trading stations in the Espírito Santo estuary. These stations were protected by small forts, usually incapable, however, of withstanding attacks by the natives. In 1779 the Austrian ship \"Joseph und Theresia\" of the Austrian East India Company lands at the bay and the Austrians erect the St. Joseph and St. Maria forts. In 1778, an Austrian expedition led by English adventurer William Bolts established a trading factory at Delagoa Bay. The factory, composed of 155 men and a number of women, traded in ivory, reaching as high as 75,000 pounds per year until the factory was expelled by the Portuguese in 1781.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1989, he starred in the Japanese-Hong Kong co-production of Bloodfight. This was the first of its kind in which English was spoken throughout the entire film. In 1992, Yam gained critical acclaim for his role as the maniacal Judge in the crime film Full Contact, where he faced off in a bloody battle against Chow Yun-fat's character. In 1993, he starred as \"Dhalsim\" in the action-comedy film Future Cops, a parody of Street Fighter directed by Wong Jing. In 1996, Yam began his role as Chiang Tin-Sung, the leader of the Hung Hing triads in the first three instalments of the Young and Dangerous film series.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1845, the Warsaw Governorate had established a new coat of arms, in form of a shield divided into seven fields, in three rows. The two bottom rows consisted of four rectangular fields of equal sizes, with two fields in both rows. The top row consisted of three triangular fields, with curved boundaries between them. It was dived into two smaller fields that bordered the sidewall and the row below, and a field twice the size of other two, located in the middle of the row, bordering the top wall. The top left field featured a red background, with a white (silver) Lamb of God facing right, with its head turned left, and a yellow (golden) aureola behind it. It hold a white (silver) banner with the red cross on it, and stood next to a yellow (golden) chalice, to which, it was bleeding blood from its chest. The top central field consisted of white and red chessboard, with the head of a black aurochs with a yellow (golden) crown, and a yellow (golden) ring in its nose. The top right field featured a background divided vertically onto two identical stripes, yellow and red. It depicted a left-facing half of a white lion, joined with a right-facing half of a white (silver) eagle, both wearing together a yellow (golden) crown on their head. The central left field featured a red background with a white (silver) eagle, with raised wings, its head turned left, and a yellow (golden) legs. The central right field featured a yellow (golden) background, with a left-facing half of a black lion, joined with a right-facing half of a white (silver) eagle, both wearing together a yellow (golden) crown on their heads. The bottom left field featured a background divided vertically onto two identical stripes, white and red. It depicted a left-facing half of a red lion, joined with a right-facing half of a white (silver) eagle, both wearing together a yellow (golden) crown on their heads. The bottom right field featured a red background, with a red eagle with raised wings, its head turned left, and a yellow (golden) legs, and a yellow (golden) letter R in a ring, placed on its chest. The four charges represented a historical subdivisions of Poland, that used to exist within the borders of the voivodeship. Those were from left to right, and from top to bottom: Wieluń Land, Kalisz Voivodeship, Sieradz Voivodeship, Masovian Voivodeship, voivodeships of Brześć Kujawski and Inowrocław, Łęczyca Voivodeship, and Rawa Voivodeship. The coat of arms had been used until 1866.\n\nParagraph 10: During the reign of Charles VI, Eleonore and her daughter-in-law Wilhelmine Amalia engaged in the succession on behalf of Joseph I's daughters. Through the secret Mutual Pact of Succession (Pactum Mutuae Successionis) of 1703, signed by both Joseph and Charles with the knowledge and consent of their father, was determined that if both brothers died without surviving male issue, the daughters of the elder brother would have absolute precedence over the daughters of the younger brother, meaning that the eldest daughter of Joseph would ascend all the Habsburg thrones. In the case that both brothers died without surviving issue, their surviving sisters would be the heiresses. This secret pact was only known to Leopold I, his sons and Count Johann Friedrich von Seilern und Aspang. Neither Eleonore or her daughters-in-law knew for certain that the document existed, but they had heard of it, but both were very active in establishing the truth and pressuring Charles to establish a public succession order, which would be necessary for court protocol. In 1712, Wilhelmine Amalia managed to persuade Count Seilern to give her the document, which she sent to the head of her family George Louis, Elector, who sent Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, to help her to negotiate with Charles VI her daughters' rights. When Charles VI presented the original version of the Pactum Mutuae Successionis on 21 April 1713, Wilhelmine Amalia had triumphed in making him recognize the secret succession order of 1703. It was at a dinner with Eleonore, in the presence of the numerous archduchesses, that Seilern informed them of this. However, the success of Wilhelmine Amalia was short-lived: only a few days before, on 19 April, Charles VI already announced his wish to amend the Pact in order to give his own future daughters precedence over his nieces in a secret session of the council."}

The planning inspector ruled in favor of preserving the main building, and a compromise plan was approved in 2011. The main hospital building is currently being restored and converted into flats.", "Uracil DNA glycosylases are enzymes that remove uracil from DNA. This uracil can occur through spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the incorrect incorporation of dU opposite dA during DNA replication. The most well-known uracil DNA glycosylase is E. coli UDG. Mammalian cells have four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities: UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4. These glycosylases differ in their substrate specificity and where they are located within the cell. \n\nSMUG1 has a preference for single-stranded DNA but can also remove uracil from double-stranded DNA. It can remove various forms of uracil, including 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, and 5-formyluracil with oxidized groups at carbon 5. \n\nTDG and MBD4 are specific to double-stranded DNA. TDG can remove thymine glycol when it is opposite guanine and can also remove modified forms of uracil at carbon 5. MBD4 is specifically involved in repairing T:G mismatches that result from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine at CpG sites.\n\nIn human cells, TDG and SMUG1 are primarily responsible for repairing U:G mismatches caused by cytosine deamination, while UNG handles the repair of uracil arising from dU misincorporation. MBD4 is mostly involved in correcting T:G mismatches at CpG sites. Mutant MBD4 mice do not show increased susceptibility to cancer or reduced survival, but they do have more C to T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.", "The text describes the concept of \"zappers\" in the context of convergence culture, as discussed in Henry Jenkins' book. Zappers are individuals who frequently switch channels, watching snippets of shows rather than committing to a prolonged engagement. It is noted that being a zapper is more of a tendency rather than a defining characteristic, and it can vary depending on factors such as the content being aired and personal feelings towards a show. The text also mentions that the concept of zappers was popularized in the 1990s, with viewers being described as needing constant gratification and frequently switching channels."], "answers": ["Paragraph 6", "Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 8"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Uracil DNA glycosylases remove uracil from DNA, which can arise either by spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the misincorporation of dU opposite dA during DNA replication.  The prototypical member of this family is E. coli UDG, which was among the first glycosylases discovered.  Four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities have been identified in mammalian cells, including UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4.  They vary in substrate specificity and subcellular localization.  SMUG1 prefers single-stranded DNA as substrate, but also removes U from double-stranded DNA.  In addition to unmodified uracil, SMUG1 can excise 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil bearing an oxidized group at ring C5.  TDG and MBD4 are strictly specific for double-stranded DNA.  TDG can remove thymine glycol when present opposite guanine, as well as derivatives of U with modifications at carbon 5.  Current evidence suggests that, in human cells, TDG and SMUG1 are the major enzymes responsible for the repair of the U:G mispairs caused by spontaneous cytosine deamination, whereas uracil arising in DNA through dU misincorporation is mainly dealt with by UNG.  MBD4 is thought to correct T:G mismatches that arise from deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine in CpG sites.  MBD4 mutant mice develop normally and do not show increased cancer susceptibility or reduced survival. But they acquire more C T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.\n\nParagraph 2: In 2012, in the case of 907 Whitehead Street, Inc. vs U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), the plaintiff challenged the jurisdiction of the USDA and its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to regulate the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum as an animal exhibitor.  The museum is home to dozens of polydactyl cats, the progeny of a cat that Ernest Hemingway was given as a pet when he lived there during the 1930s.  Following a complaint by a museum visitor, the USDA visited the museum and in October 2003, determined that the Museum was an animal exhibitor subject to regulation under the AWA because the Museum exhibited the cats for the cost of an admission fee, and the cats were used in promotional advertising. Under USDA regulations, the museum is required to obtain a USDA exhibitor's license, give each cat a tag for identification purposes,  provide additional resting surfaces within their existing enclosures, and introduce one of several specified improvements required to ensure the cats remain contained to the museum's grounds.  The museum challenged on several grounds the USDA's authority in the case, noting that the Hemingway cats do not have an effect on interstate commerce sufficient to merit federal regulation.  As of December 2012, the case had reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which upheld earlier district court rulings.\n\nParagraph 3: environment. End of Ages offers players three navigation modes to explore. The first, \"Classic mode\", uses the same controls used in Myst and Riven; Ages are divided into locations of interest, or nodes, and the player's view is fixed at every node. Players advance to other nodes by clicking on portions of the screen. The \"Classic Plus\" mode uses the control scheme of Myst III: Exile and Myst IV: Revelation; movement is still node-based but players can rotate their view 360 degrees in any direction. The final navigation mode, known as \"Free Look\" or \"Advanced\" mode, allows players to navigate and observe the Ages freely like Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. The WASD keyboard keys are used for walking forward, backward, and sideways, while the mouse changes the player's point of view.\n\nParagraph 4: In the beginning of Al-Muzzammil (Quran 73), God expounds upon the merits of night prayer in the First Meccan Period. Muhammad, and subsequently the Muslim community, is commanded to “stay up throughout the night, all but a small part of it, half, or a little less, or a little more; recite the Qur’an slowly and distinctly.” During the First Meccan Period, the total Qur'anic revelation was brief enough to recite during the night. As such, it was expected of Muslims to recite the Qur'an in full during the night. The night prayer was of such importance, because the believer's focus on prayer and separation from any distraction was believed to “make a deeper impression” on the believer.\n\nParagraph 5: The brotherhood originated in the 15th century, but it is not known when exactly it was founded. Hans Talhoffer may have been an early member, or even one of the founders (the lion of St Mark appears in his coat of arms in a manuscript of 1459). The earliest certain attestation dates to 1474. The group held an annual meeting in Frankfurt, where they elected their captain (Hauptmann). In 1487, Frederick III granted them the monopoly on the title \"master of the long sword\" (Meister des langen Schwerts), effectively making them a fencers' guild. This title was relevant for the Landsknechts, because a certified \"master of the long sword\" wielding the Zweihänder was entitled to twice the pay of a normal soldier (Doppelsöldner).\n\nParagraph 6: The Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children, \"an important part of Brighton life and a well known local landmark\", was officially opened on 21 July 1881 and was used until 22 June 2007, when a new children's hospital opened on the Royal Sussex County Hospital campus elsewhere in the city. Designed by Thomas Lainson, it was a three-storey Queen Anne-style building of red brick with terracotta dressings and mouldings, enlivened by Dutch gables, cupolas and a moulded cartouche. Extensions included a colonnade of balconies (later enclosed) by the Clayton & Black firm in 1906 and a Vernacular-style recessed wing of two storeys in 1927–28, partly tile-hung and with timber decoration to the gables. The first mention of its potential closure came in 2001, when the Government allocated £28 million towards new facilities at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on Eastern Road in Kemptown. By 2004, it seemed likely that the building would be demolished and the site redeveloped with luxury flats. Montpelier residents were unsuccessful in their attempt to get the former hospital listed by English Heritage, who stated that Lainson's original design had been altered so much that much of its character had been lost. Taylor Wimpey, a housebuilding company, bought the hospital in December 2006, but their proposals to clear the site and build a combined residential development and GP surgery were refused twice by the city council, in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 Taylor Wimpey appealed against the latest refusal to grant planning permission for 149 flats and a four-day public inquiry was held at Brighton Town Hall in May 2009. The local conservation group, the Montpelier and Clifton Hill Association, led the opposition to Taylor Wimpey's plans to demolish the hospital. The planning inspector, John Papworth, turned down Taylor Wimpey's appeal, praising the architectural quality of Thomas Lainson's main building. \"I consider that the main block and particularly its southern façade and the southern end of the Dyke Road frontage contribute positively to the character and appearance of the conservation area,” said Papworth. In 2010 Taylor Wimpey abandoned its plans to clear the site and put forward a compromise plan, which kept the main Lainson building but demolished the later ancillary buildings on the site. This plan, which was supported by the Montpelier and Clifton Hill Association was approved by the council in 2011. Flats on the site went on sale (marketed as Royal Alexandra Quarter) in 2012. The iconic main hospital building, to be called the Lainson building, is currently being restored and converted to provide 20 flats.\n\nParagraph 7: Despite a one-night stand with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship in Spain, prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Roy have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\nParagraph 8: Referred to in Henry Jenkins' book, Convergence Culture, published in 2006, describes individuals who \"constantly flit across the dial—watching snippets of shows rather than sitting down for a prolonged engagement\" (Jenkins 2006:75). More of a tendency than a defining characteristic, zappers can fluctuate from the habit, depending on what is on at any given time, personal feelings toward a show, amongst other variables. The concept was overstated in the 1990s when Phillip Swann \"wrote in TV.com: How Television is Shaping Our Future: ‘Few viewers today can sit through an entire program without picking up the remote and checking out another channel . . . Today’s viewer needs constant gratification: If she’s not entertained or intrigued for any stretch of time, she will flip the dial'\" (Jenkins 2006:75).\n\nParagraph 9: Towards the end of 1937, hundreds of overseas Chinese working in Japanese-owned industries in Malaya went on strike. At the time, the Japanese government owned an iron mine in Bukit Besi near Dungun, Terengganu where about 3,000 workers were employed. The iron ore was shipped to Japan and used as raw material to manufacture weapons. Lim believed that if the workers in the Dungun mine went on strike, the Japanese would suffer a huge loss, so he planned to make the workers go on strike. Around February 1938, Lim travelled to Dungun with Zhuang Huiquan () of the Anxi clan association to carry out their plan. Zhuang went to the mine to persuade the workers to go on strike while Lim contacted the local police and gained their support. By early March, Lim and Zhuang achieved success as many workers left the mine and followed them to Singapore. On 11 March 1938, Lim and the Singaporean Chinese community held a welcoming ceremony for the workers, who later resettled and found employment in Singapore.\n\nParagraph 10: is a 2003 film directed by Fukutani Osamu. The movie follows Yū (played by Kenji Mizuhashi), a cameraman who works for a small TV station. He and his assistant Rie (Chisato Morishita) are sent by their superior, Keita (Hideo Sakaki), to investigate a case of group suicide in which four people poisoned themselves with carbon monoxide. When they enter the apartment they accidentally run into a teenage girl, Nanami Kumatani (played by Ayaka Maede) who was in the pact but backed out at the last minute out of fear. The girl tells them about 'Ricki' (played by Yûko Nakamura) and agrees to show them her suicide manual in exchange for letting her look on the roof of their office. Yū and Rie agree and they take her there. They become possessed by evil spirits and commit suicide as a result of this encounter. In sequel The Suicide Manual: Intermediate Level (2003) the 'Suicide Manual' DVD produced by Yu and Rie about the case causes more people to commit suicide. A forensic investigation is held after a forensics lab tech fails to stop his girlfriend killing herself. The end of the film reveals the 'evil spirit' causing these events to have been the producer of the 'Suicide Manual' DVD."}

He traveled for a year in Great Britain and Europe and then through the United States, settling in Staten Island in the 1850s. After contributing to periodicals, short sketches, and stories, which attracted little attention, Winthrop enlisted in the 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, an early volunteer unit of the Federal Army that answered President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops in 1861. He wrote a popular essay about the experience titled \"Our March to Washington.\"  He was appointed Major and soon became an aide-de-camp to Major General Benjamin Butler, commander of the Department of Virginia headquartered at Fort Monroe.  Winthrop had, along with his younger brother William Winthrop who later became the nation's leading authority on military law, long been an abolitionist.  Butler credited Winthrop with first formulating the policy that automatically conferred freedmen status on escaped slaves who entered into Union Army held territory.\n\nParagraph 3: ReviewsDJ Hero has received positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart of the music genre given the large number of titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed to meet the needs of the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from \"Medium\" to \"Hard\" and \"Expert\" levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the \"Easy\" difficulty being \"less thrilling and engaging\" compared to Guitar Hero, the game was \"structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit\" with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in \"Hard\" mode over \"Medium\" were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in \"Hard\" and \"Expert\" modes.   Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both \"a bane and a boon\"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.\n\nParagraph 4: backstreet 'to date in secret' bang jago (from abang 'older brother' and jago 'champion; master'; used to end any argument in a passive-aggressive and ad hominem manner)baper 'touchy' (from bawa perasaan )banget, from Javanese banget 'very'basian 'hangover'beud 'very' (from banget 'very'; this word has become popular after Indonesia's fast food chain, CFC coined the word on one of their television advertisement)bokep 'blue film' (from the abbreviation of \"blue film\", BF, which is read as bé-èf or bé-èp then transformed into a prokem word using infix -ok-)bokep 'stupid' (from the acronym of \"bodoh\" and \"tolol\")buzzeRp 'political buzzer' (a portmanteau of buzzer politik 'political buzzer' and Rupiah)cabe-cabean 'slut' (from cabe , from the abbreviation of cewek alay bisa diewe ; the term derived from teen motorbike gang/underground racing subculture where sometimes the ante was the racers' girlfriends and the winner could sleep with her)capcus 'let's go' (from cabut 'to pull off something', colloquially means 'to go'; popularized by LGBT community)cebong (; a pejorative name for Joko Widodo's supporters)ciyus 'serious' (from serius 'serious')cupu 'out of date, not trendy; nerd' (from culun punya , culun 'out of date; nerd' and punya 'to have, to possess'; it became popular after Indonesia's beverage brand, Pop Ice, coined it in their television advertisement in 2007)doang from Betawi doang 'just'fafifu wasweswos or fa fi fu was wes wos 'nonsensical', 'gibberish'.gebetan 'crush' (from gebet 'to approach, to get closer to someone', itself a slang)GR or geer 'to have a prejudice about itself' (from gede rasa )garing 'lame, corny' (from garing 'dry')halo, dek or halodek, an epithet for Indonesian policeman and soldiers corps, due to their flirtatious yet creepy and perverted behaviour, such as catcalling against girls (especially doctors, pharmacists, midwives, and nurses), both online and offline.Indog (from \"Indonesian dog\" or \"Indognesial\"; a pejorative name for Indonesia and Indonesian)jamet (from jablay/janda mètal 'women who dresses and acts overly provocative but didn't care about their appearance and won't bother to take care about themselves', jajal metal 'metal poseur', or Jawa metal 'metalhead Javanese'; a pejorative name for Javanese people)jebakan betmen 'prank' ()jijay 'disgusting, grotesque' (from jijik 'disgusting'; sometimes used to express a condition of 'utmost disgust', used in the phrase \"jijay bajay\" or \"anjay jijay\")jomblo or jombs 'single' (from Sundanese jomblo 'unable to sell (the product); unrequited')jutek 'sassy; rude'kadrun (from kadal gurun ; a pejorative name for Islamic bigot).kenti 'penis' (from kontol 'penis')kimpoi 'sexual intercourse' (from kawin 'to have sex')kinclong 'shiny; good looking'kuproy 'construction worker' (from kuli proyek 'construction worker'; sometimes pejorative)kutu kupret 'bastard'lebay 'overacting' (from lebih 'more' with exaggerated English pronunciation imitation, or from Sumatran Malay labaih/lebaih 'excessive; crossing the line')lesbiola 'lesbian' (from lesbi 'lesbian', extended into the word les biola )maho 'gay men' (from manusia homo 'homosexual man')matre 'materialistic' (from materialistik)memek 'vagina' (from Sundanese momok 'vagina' in polite form)miapa or miapah 'really?'

Prior to the timeline of the series, he had helped Herman land a job as a fact checker in the research department. A smooth-talking ladies' man, Jay often is more gutsy when it comes to pursuing women, and typically, is subject to periodic rejection from women who do not tolerate his machismo and clichéd pick-up lines. He is often looked to by Herman as a level of confidence to aspire to, while Jay eventually ponders how Herman's more cautious, \"nice guy\" persona could work to his advantage. He has also made Herman feel insecure at times because of his position in the company being higher than Herman's. A frequent visitor to the research department, Jay always drops in to have spirited conversation with his best buddy, whom he always calls \"Hermo\", \"The Hermster\", or some variation thereof. Originally, Jay is exclusively seen chasing after flashy, status-conscious women, most notably Heddy Newman, who continually turns him down and gives him very little acknowledgement during his visits to the research department. He was engaged to a woman he was hopelessly in love with, but she left him at the altar—which nearly destroyed him. And so he now regards relationships with women as just for sex. His ex-fiancée returns and he falls back in love with her. He prepares to leave all of New York to go away with her, but she abandons him again. Jay pretends he left her this time, but Herman pretends he does not know that she left him. By the third season, Herman fixes up Jay with Louise Fitzer, and the two become an item. They begin to fall in love with each other.\n\nParagraph 6: Silver, who is going simply by her last name, is introduced during the pilot and quickly becomes good friends with Annie Wilson, and develops a romantic interest in Annie's adopted brother Dixon Wilson, which quickly blossoms into a relationship. Before the first season, Silver warns Annie not to trust Naomi Clark, informing her that they were once best friends. Silver tells Annie that during their friendship, Silver confided in Naomi about her father's affair, but that Naomi caused it to become public knowledge; this resulted in Silver's mother relapsing. During the series, Silver celebrates her half-birthday because her mother always seems to mess up her real birthday. In \"By Accident\", Dixon dumps Silver after taking advice from his mother, but later in 'Help Me, Rhonda' they get back together after Silver finally admits that she is in love with him. On Valentine's Day, Dixon and Silver lose their virginity to one another. It has been clear from the start of the season that Silver has a slightly manic personality, but in \"Life's a Drag\", she becomes more unbalanced. She visits Dixon at the Peach Pit, where they end up having sex. Silver secretly tapes it and then shows the tape to an entire theater, causing Dixon to break up with her. She ends up breaking into Ryan Matthews' house, claiming that he destroyed her relationship with Dixon, and threatening him with a bottle of wine unless he fixes everything. Silver then attempts to run away to Kansas, stating repeatedly that going there would help her solve her problems with Dixon. At the station, a stranger notices her erratic behavior, and after she falls asleep, borrows her phone and calls someone to come get her. Dixon and his mother and father find her on the train tracks. Dixon remembers his birth mother, who had bipolar disorder, displayed the same symptoms, and realizes that Silver suffers from it also. Dixon calms Silver down and they take her to the hospital. Soon, Silver finds it unbearable to go back to West Beverly High due to the gossip surrounding her recent behavior, and decides to move to St. Claire's School. She initially tries to make a fresh start, but another girl recognizes her and wants her to be honest with the other students, going so far as doing a hunger strike until Silver sends the video to everyone. Silver then reprimands her because she's now considered a slut by everyone else. After Dixon gets a large number of students to vote for her as a write-in, Silver is awarded the West Bev \"prom queen\" at that year's prom, but admits that she's not prom material, which creates distance between her and Dixon. Later at Naomi's after party, whilst swimming, Dixon and Ethan end up confronting one another, which leads to Ethan Ward admitting that he likes her. Silver later runs into Ethan and asks him about his statement, she tells him that they are just friends, to which Ethan responds by kissing her and telling her that he doesn't think that they're just friends and that he doesn't want them to be just friends.\n\nParagraph 7: A digital ion trap (DIT) is an ion trap having a trapping waveform generated by the rapid switching between discrete high-voltage levels. The timing of the high voltage switch is controlled precisely with digital electronic circuitry. Ion motion in a quadrupole ion trap driven by a rectangular wave signal was theoretically studied in 1970s by Sheretov, E.P. and Richards, J.A. Sheretov also implemented the pulsed waveform drive for the quadrupole ion trap working in mass-selective instability mode, although no resonance excitation/ejection was used. The idea was substantially revisited by Ding L. and Kumashiro S. in 1999, where the ion stability in the rectangular wave quadrupole field was mapped in the Mathieu space a-q coordinate system, with the parameters a and q having the same definition as the Mathieu parameters normally used in dealing with sinusoidal RF driven quadrupole field. The secular frequency dependence on the a, q parameters was also derived thus the foundation was laid for many modern ion trap operation modes based on the resonance excitation. Also, in 1999, Peter T.A. Reilly began trapping and subsequently ablating and mass analyzing the product ions from nanoparticles obtained from car exhaust with a primitive hybrid square wave/sine wave driven 3D ion trap. In 2001 Reilly attended the 49th American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Applied Topics where he presented his nanoparticle mass analysis work and met Li Ding for the first time. Reilly suggested to Ding at that time that they should focus the DIT for analysis in the high mass range where other instruments could not compete. However, work published by Ding and Shimadzu over the years following the 2001 meeting were focused on development of square wave driven DIT's in the conventional mass range of commercial instrumentation. During this time Reilly began developing digital waveforms to increase the mass range of quadrupole-based mass spectrometers and ion traps that operate with rectangular waveforms. Over the course of eighteen years, the Reilly group contributed substantially to the development of modern digital waveform technology (DWT), its implementation and characterization, methods of waveform generation, and general theory which includes but is not limited to stability diagrams, the pseudopotential model, and more recently digital quadrupole acceptance. In parallel to Reilly's achievements but also working separately, the Ding group at the Shimadzu Research Lab continued to implement their digital drive technology for a 3D ion trap. Finally, after 18 years Shimadzu unveiled a bench top MALDI square wave driven 3D ion trap mass spectrometer that was designed to work in the higher mass range at the 2019 ASMS conference. The DIT technology has also been developed and implemented in the linear and 3D quadrupole ion traps by many other groups around the world.\n\nParagraph 8: McClanahan's career-long 41-yard run on Minnesota's first play of the game set up quarterback Fran Tarkenton's 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Stu Voigt. Eddie Brown gave his team some early scoring opportunities with big special teams plays, first returning the kickoff 26 yards to the 38-yard line, and later returning a punt 17 yards to the Vikings 45.  But the team was unable to capitalize.  All they could do after the kickoff return was go three-and-out, and on the first play after his big punt return, Billy Kilmer threw a pass that was intercepted by Bobby Bryant.  Now momentum seemed slipping away, but on the first play after Bryant's pick, Washington took the ball right back with an interception by safety Jake Scott, who returned it 17 yards to the Minnesota 34-yard line.  Three plays later, Mark Moseley kicked a 47-yard field goal that cut the Washington deficit to 7-3. Later in the quarter, Minnesota drove 66 yards and scored when Tarkenton threw a 27-yard pass to Sammy White.  Safety Ken Houston deflected the ball, but it still bounced to White, who made a diving juggling catch for a touchdown to put the Vikings up 14-3.  By the end of the first quarter, the Vikings had gained 143 yards, while holding Washington to 18 yards and no first downs.\n\nParagraph 9: Seda has appeared in more than two dozen movies, including Bad Boys II (2003) as Roberto, as well as numerous television appearances. Aside from Homicide, he has had notable roles as Dino Ortolani in Oz, Matty Caffey in  Third Watch, Paul Falsone (in a Homicide crossover with Law & Order), House, and CSI: Miami. He is featured as one of the three leads in the  HBO World War II mini-series The Pacific (released on March 14, 2010), portraying Marine John Basilone. Seda appeared as a guest star in an episode of Burn Notice, and in 2007 he made a cameo appearance in Ludacris' song \"Runaway Love\", as an abusive, alcoholic stepfather.\n\nParagraph 10: While as an undergraduate at the University of Dayton, Thomas worked with the college's basketball team for three years. He helped the coaching staff with player workouts and had roles such running video exchange, maintaining the video library, and writing opponent scouting reports. In 2003, Thomas joined the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, where he assumed the position of head assistant coach. While at the school, he was also the recruiting and academic coordinator. He had the additional responsibility of scouting the team's opponents. In August 2015, Thomas became a part of the coaching staff for the RedHawks of Miami University. He assumed the role as administrative assistant and helped the team by overseeing film exchange, film edits, study tables, and travel arrangements. While Thomas was at Miami, the team won the Mid-American Conference tournament and appeared in the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Following his tenure with Miami, Thomas spent time with the Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls, and Utah Jazz, as an NBA Advance Scout. He worked with the Slovenia national basketball team for two summers as an assistant coach where he worked with NBA Players Goran Dragic, Zoran Dragic, and Boki Nachbar. In September 2015, Thomas joined the Orangeville A's of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) as a head coach. In the summer of 2016, Thomas took over the Head Coaching position of the Luoyan Golden Stars in the NBL of China where he coached former NBA Champion Josh Powell and led them to the NBL Playoffs.  In September 2016, Thomas joined the Westports Malaysia Dragons of the ASEAN Basketball League as their new head coach. After resigning from the Westports Malaysia Dragons, Thomas then became the Head Coach of KK Zlatorog Lasko where he led the team to the best regular season turnaround in wins the Slovenian League for the 18-19 season.

While some argue that tourbillons never improved accuracy, they are still highly valued by collectors and are often found in premium-priced watches. Swiss luxury watchmakers produce high-quality tourbillon wristwatches that can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in availability and a slight decrease in prices for basic tourbillon models.

There is even debate amongst horologists as to whether tourbillons ever improved the accuracy of mechanical watches, even when first introduced, or whether the watches of the day were inherently inaccurate due to design and manufacturing techniques.  A tourbillon is a valued feature of collectors' and premium-priced watches, possibly for the same reason that mechanical watches fetch a much higher price than similar quartz watches that are much more accurate.  High-quality tourbillon wristwatches, usually made by the Swiss luxury watch industry, are very expensive, and typically retail for tens of thousands of dollars or euros, with much higher prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros being common.  A recent renaissance of interest in tourbillons has been met by the industry with increased availability of time pieces bearing the feature, with the result that prices for basic tourbillon models have reduced somewhat in recent years. Previously such models were very rare, either antique or new. Any watch with a tourbillon will cost a great deal more than an equivalent piece without the feature. The prices of Swiss models typically start at $40,000 and the prices of more expensive tourbillon watches can reach six figures. The prices of some Chinese models can range from hundreds of dollars to nearly $5000.\n\nParagraph 2: Bolstered by the younger players, the Thistles finished second in the Manitoba intermediate league in 1899–1900. They won the league title in 1900–01, greatly outscoring their opponents. When the team started the 1901–02 season with a lopsided 12–0 victory, the club's executives became concerned. They felt if the games were not competitive people would not come to watch them, resulting in less revenue. Believing the team was strong enough to move up, they applied to join the senior Manitoba Hockey Association, which had two teams that season, both in Winnipeg: the Victorias and the Winnipeg Rowing Club. To prove they could compete, the Thistles played an exhibition match against the Victorias, one of the best teams in Canada, and a previous winner of the Stanley Cup, the championship trophy of ice hockey in Canada. The Thistles fared well in the match, but the two Winnipeg teams decided against allowing them to join the league, arguing the Thistles applied too late in the season. Returning to the intermediate league, the Thistles, weakened by injuries to several players, finished in a tie for second overall. After the season ended Tommy Phillips, one of the best players on the Thistles, moved to Montreal to attend McGill University.\n\nParagraph 3: Despite that, in the 19th century the palace yet again fell into disuse and was parcelated between various shops and stores. Many doors and windows were added on the ground floor and the luxurious part of the palace deteriorated. In the early 20th century the palace was bought by E. Bortkiewicz, who ordered the reconstruction of the second floor. Later, after the city of Vilnius/Wilno became a part of Poland in 1922, the 2nd and 3rd floors were yet again reconstructed to house a Hotel Sokołowskiego, named after its owner. During the German bombings of Wilno during the Polish Defensive War the building was heavily damaged.  It was further damaged during Operation Ostra Brama in 1944, and only the cellars, ground floor and outer walls were preserved. Unlike many buildings on Vokiečių street, the palace was rebuilt in 1945. In 1957 the total reconstruction of the palace was led by Algimantas Umbrasas. As with most of the palaces at that time, it was reconstructed by the Soviet authorities to house small apartments.  This was due to the shortage of living space in Vilnius caused by a great deal of residential buildings having been destroyed. A fourth floor was added, yet it is invisible from the outside of the palace.\n\nParagraph 4: The first and second Gymnopédies were arranged by Dick Halligan for the group Blood, Sweat & Tears under the title \"Variations on a Theme by Erik Satie\" on the group's eponymous album, released in 1968. The recording received a Grammy Award the following year for Best Contemporary Instrumental Performance. In 1980, Gary Numan produced a track called \" (First Movement)\", which appeared on the B-side of the single \"We Are Glass\". A sample of Gymnopédie No. 1 is featured in the 2001 Janet Jackson single \"Someone to Call My Lover\", peaking at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gymnopédies have been heard in numerous movies and television shows. Examples include the documentary Man on Wire, Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums, and Woody Allen's Another Woman, all of which use Gymnopédie No. 1 in their soundtracks. The 2010 Japanese animated drama film The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya prominently features all three Gymnopédies, and they are included in the film's soundtrack release as a bonus disc, including Satie's Gnossiennes and his composition \"Je te veux\".

In 2021, violinist Fenella Humphreys released an arrangement of Gymnopedie No.1 for violin.\n\nParagraph 5: After Napoleon became First Consul, Malmaison – an estate west of Paris, owned by Napoleon’s wife Josephine – became the site of several alleged assassination plots. According to Napoleon’s valet Constant, this included a poisoning attempt.Sundry alterations and repairs had to be made in the chimney-piece of the First Consul’s apartments at La Malmaison. The person superintending this work sent certain stone-cutters, some of whom were in league with the conspirators. … Just as the First Consul was about to take up his residence in the newly-prepared apartments, upon a desk at which he sat a snuff-box was found, precisely similar to one which he was in the habit of using. At first they supposed that it actually belonged to him, and that it had been left there by his valet-de-chambre. But the suspicions aroused by the strange appearance of some of the workmen took deeper root. The snuff was taken out and analysed. It was poisoned.Constant continues:The perpetrators of this dastardly outrage were at that time in league…with other conspirators, who intended to resort to other means in order to get rid of the First Consul. They thought of attacking the Malmaison guards, and of forcibly abducting the head of the Government. For this purpose they had uniforms made exactly like those of the Guides Consulaires, who, night and day, were in attendance on the First Consul. In this disguise, and with the help of their confederates, the sham stone-cutters, they might easily have mixed with the guards who were lodged and boarded at the castle. They could even have got at the First Consul and carried him off. This first scheme, however, was abandoned as too risky, and the conspirators flattered themselves that they would gain their ends in a surer, less perilous way, viz., by taking advantage of the General’s frequent journeys to Paris. In such disguise they could join the escort, unnoticed, and murder him on the highway. Their meeting-place was to be the Nanterre quarries. But their plot was again discovered, and, as in the Malmaison park there was a rather deep quarry, it was feared that they might hide here and do the General some injury when he walked out by himself. So the entrance to this place was closed with an iron gate.Constant may have been referring to an alleged plot by a man named Juvenot, a former aide-de-camp to the executed Jacobin leader François Hanriot. According to Napoleon’s Minister of Police Joseph Fouché, Juvenot was conspiring in mid-1800 with “some twenty zealots” to attack and murder Napoleon near Malmaison. The plan was to block the road to Malmaison with carts and bundles of firewood; when Napoleon’s carriage was forced to stop, the conspirators would shoot him. They also thought of setting fire to cottages near Malmaison, expecting that Napoleon’s staff would run to put out the flames, leaving the First Consul unguarded. Fouché had Juvenot and his accomplices arrested, but was unable to extract a confession.\n\nParagraph 6: William Hart was born in Paisley, Scotland, and in 1831 emigrated to the United States with his family, settling in Albany, New York. He was apprenticed to a decorative painter in Albany and Troy, New York, and his first artistic experience was in decorating the panels of coaches with landscapes. He also spent time as a portrait painter, likely after 1834.  He toured the mid-western States, predominantly Michigan, during the late 1830s seeking portrait commissions, and was unsuccessful.  He exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1848, and returned to Albany permanently in 1849.  In late 1849, he was underwritten by a Dr. Ormsby to travel to Europe to study landscape painting.  He painted primarily in Scotland until 1852, after which he returned to Albany, and then in 1853, moved to New York City. By the time he returned to America, Hart had shifted his energy to landscape painting. Like most of the major American landscape artists of the time, Hart settled in New York City, where he opened a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building in 1858.  In 1865, he was elected President of the Brooklyn Academy of Design.\n\nParagraph 7: On September 27, 2005, Claire Kiriakis was born at St. Luke's during the almost wedding of Sami Brady and Lucas Roberts delivered by her maternal grandmother, Marlena Evans, and Lexie Carver. Philip and Belle chose Claire as her name when she was born, Mimi Lockhart and Shawn-Douglas Brady became Godparents. Claire became very ill when she was just a few months old and Belle took her to the hospital. It was there that Kate found out Claire's blood type was AB- and knew that she wasn't Philip's daughter. She kept it from Philip and Belle but told Victor. Mimi found out the same information and kept it secret, because she was marrying Shawn and didn't want him to find out the truth and go back to Belle. A little after thanksgiving, Claire needed a liver transplant and her doctor Lexi Carver found Claire's uncle Zack Brady as a match. He had died the same night and his liver was donated to Claire. She survived and went home with Philip and Belle. It was a few months later that Mimi spilled the news to Shawn that she too knew all along that Claire wasn't Philip's baby. Belle and Philip had a DNA test done and Philip was devastated. Later, Belle took Claire to her parents and left Philip, after she miscarried. Philip tried to get full custody of Claire after he returned from war, but Belle and Shawn took the baby and ran to Toronto and stayed at a shelter where 'Merle' helped them escape to Australia on a cruise ship. Upon their return to Salem, Philip promised to leave Claire with her rightful family. Claire was aged at this point and then kidnapped by Crystal Miller and brought to New Ross, Ireland for protection. This is where she was found in January 2008 by Hope, Bo, John, Marlena, Belle, Chloe, Philip and Shawn. Claire's grandmother Colleen Brady revealed the source of the Brady/DiMera feud when she admitted to her affair with Santo DiMera. She also revealed that she was John's mother, making her Claire's great-grandmother. Colleen admitted to everyone that she was terminally ill and died shortly after. On the way home from Ireland, Claire and her parents, along with everyone else flying back, faced a traumatic plane crash due to sabotage caused by Ava Vitali. Claire's great-grandfather, Shawn Brady, died a hero on the plane saving his son's life. Upon arrival in Salem, Claire's grandfather, Bo, was rushed to the hospital for pancreatic failure and went through a life-saving surgery. Claire's parents, Belle and Shawn, reunited and decided to take Claire and sail around the world.\n\nParagraph 8: Specific information on how much Freda and Bava directed the film differ between interviews and recollections. Freda noted with an interview with Luigi Cozzi in 1971 that he \"left it when there were just two days of shooting left. I did shoot it yes, but it's Bava's type of film. I don't enclose it in my body of work. The only thing I remember with pleasure about it are the statues that decorated the sets: I sculpted them myself.\" Bava described Caltiki – The Immortal Monster as \"my very first film\", while noting that Freda had fled the set \"because everything was falling to pieces. I managed to carry it out, patching it up here and there\". Cozzi commented on his interview with Freda in 2004, stating that his own words were misinterpreted and that \"the truth is only one: the director of Calitiki il mostro immortale is Riccardo Freda, full stop. Mario Bava did take care of the cinematography, the special effects and directed the scenes with the miniatures (that is, mostly the tanks....), and in addition to that he filmed some shots of soldiers with flame throwers. That's all, and of course it cannot be enough to say that Bava directed that movie.\" Cozzi also stated that Bava spoke about the film, stating that \"I did not direct Caltiki. The director of that movie is Freda. Only at a certain point, after principal shooting ended, Freda started editing the picture and then he had a big argument with the producer [...] Then Freda walked out.\" Bava's statement from Cozzi then noted that Bava finished some special effects shot, scenes with soldiers with flame throwers for the ending of the film and declared \"that does not mean I was the director of Caltiki: that is a Riccardo Freda film.\" According to Bava's biographer Tim Lucas, Freda's walk-off left \"two or three weeks of filming\", leaving Bava to shoot over 100 special effects shots for a 76-minute long production.\n\nParagraph 9: An astronaut lands on an alien planet to investigate the death of one of a group of Earth scientists who are testing to see if the planet is suitable for colonization. The scientists, including Julie, his old flame, behave strangely, but refuse to explain why.  They are particularly nervous around Reese Fowler, a fellow researcher who seems to wear his polarized goggles all the time, necessary due to the extreme brightness of the planet's sun. One of the scientists attempts to leave a hastily scribbled note in the astronaut's spacesuit pocket, warning him of what has been happening; he exits the room, only to bump into Reese, who seems to read his mind, and then destroys him with a mere touch. The astronaut is led to a remote cave by Julie and another researcher where he discovers that the others live in fear of Reese, who developed superhuman abilities when he was accidentally exposed to the planet's radioactive isotope-laden rainfall, which has mutating properties, resulting in the scientist's loss of hair and in the development of protruding eyes. Reese, knowing that if the others return to Earth he will be left behind because of the danger he poses, has been holding the others captive, while threatening his touch if they reveal the secret of his plight, all the time searching for a cure. The astronaut must somehow overcome a man who can read minds, and kill with a touch. To prevent Reese from knowing of his plans, the investigator is given a post-hypnotic suggestion to forget what he has learned, then—provided with a code word to recall the events—inform his superiors on Earth following his return. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Reese discovers the deception, and pursues the investigator and Julie into the cave, where they had met once before, with the intent to destroy them; however, due to his sensitivity to darkness, Reese apparently dies from the intense pain while trying to absorb the dim glow of a candle's flame into his light-starved eyes.\n\nParagraph 10: The label notably discovered and released the debut album of Home Grown but was best known for releasing compilation albums credited with advancing the careers of several young artists. The most memorable of the compilations, Punk Sucks and Ska Sucks, included tracks from then little known punk, pop-punk, and ska artists who would soon rise to fame internationally, including Sublime, Blink 182, Dance Hall Crashers, Less Than Jake, Hepcat, Millencolin, The Pietasters, Good Riddance, 88 Fingers Louie, The Bouncing Souls and Pennywise.  The label has also released the cult classic \"When Pregnasaurs Ruled the Earth\" by Donuts N' Glory and reissued albums from Less Than Jake, The Queers, Screeching Weasel, The Vindictives, and Frenzal Rhomb, among others."}

A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed Caucasians at the pinnacle and Negroes at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between. His research of ancient Egyptians was meant to show that this racial hierarchy had always existed and should remain in place. When confronted with evidence that many ancient Egyptians had dark skin like other Africans, Morton used skull measurements to corroborate the words of Georges Curvier: \"whatever may have been the hue of their skin, they belonged to the same race with ourselves.\" Aside from this occasionally dark-skinned Caucasian ruling class, Morton's skull measurements led him to admit \"Negroes were numerous in Egypt but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is, that of servants and slaves.\" Morton's scholarship greatly contributed to Egyptology and several other disciplines adopting the Hamitic Hypothesis, the idea that civilization is antithetical to Negroes and a legacy of the Caucasian race such that any evidence of civilization in Africa must have derived from Caucasian presence or influence. Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.\n\nParagraph 3: All of the industrialization would engulf and obscure the area from public access and view. The presence of railroads within the downtown core was noted by the Olmsted Brothers in 1908 when they began to develop a master plan for parks in the City of Spokane.  As the brothers were planning in the Spokane River Gorge, they skipped the area that would later become the site of Expo '74, sarcastically noting that it had already been partially \"improved\" (with all the industrial development that was present) and hoped that the City of Spokane would eventually come to its senses and reclaim the area around the Spokane Falls for a park. Spokane would go on to become the site of four transcontinental railroads, including Great Northern, Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, as well as regional ones like Oregon Railway. By 1914, Union Pacific had built their own station on the park's site, along with elevated tracks leading up to it. The heart of Downtown Spokane would become a hub for passenger and freight rail transport and remained that way for several decades. By the mid-20th century, the problems of having a large amount of railroads in the middle of the city were beginning to be realized. The elevated railway, warehouses, and other lines leading into the park severely restricted both physical and visual access to the Spokane River and its falls, leading some locals to compare it to the Great Wall of China.  Additionally, the high volume of train traffic created a very noisy downtown, and numerous at-grade railroad crossings were causing traffic congestion issues.\n\nParagraph 4: As a means of retaliation, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces assembled a team of 31 social outcasts including criminals on death row and life imprisonment, in a plot to kill Kim Il-sung. The team is designated 'Unit 684'. The recruits are taken to the island of Silmido for training. The mission is offered to the recruits as the only way to redeem themselves and show their loyalty to their country. If they succeed, they will win their freedom and a new life. With this goal in mind, they endure their training. The training is shown over several months, with the recruits enduring various forms of extremely vigorous training and regular physical punishment, including being branded. One recruit is killed after he falls from a ropes course.\n\nParagraph 5: Lauffen is located in the southern part of the district of Heilbronn,  south of Heilbronn and  north of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart, on the Neckar. The small river Zaber flows into the Neckar at this point. The neck of the previous great bow in the course of the north-flowing Neckar was broken through by erosion somewhere between 400 BC and 100 BC and for several centuries the watercourse survived as a ring of lakes. The old circular riverbed is now dry, apart from one small artificial lake. Along the old riverbed, a round hill was formed – its slopes now partially covered by the Kaywald forest and with other areas given over to the cultivation of vines. There is a hill on the western bank of the Neckar at the centre point of the ancient river bow. This hill became separated from another on the present eastern bank when the river broke through.  Lauffen grew up on the western bank, on the ridge which is the site of today's Regiswindis Church.  This hill settlement became known as Lauffen-Dorf (Lauffen village). In the middle of the river, between the two hills, is an island with a castle.  This castle, originally the seat of the Earls of Lauffen, is now home to the town hall – the island itself is a nature reserve. Another settlement, Lauffen-Stadt (Lauffen town), later established itself on the hill on the eastern bank. The two districts, Lauffen-Dorf and Lauffen-Stadt, are joined by a bridge.  A smaller bridge from Lauffen-Stadt leads to the island and the town hall. Yet another district, the so-called Lauffen-Dörfle (Lauffen little village), grew up around a convent and is situated on the western bank to the north of Lauffen-Dorf and the Zaber. An exclave of Lauffen, the town's forest of Etzlenswenden, is located further east in the Löwenstein Mountains. It is presumed that this forested area was allocated to the town by its founders in around AD 1200, as there was no other forest within its boundaries from which timber and firewood could be obtained. It is here, in the exclave, that the highest point is situated  above sea level; the lowest point  above sea level is by the Neckar.\n\nParagraph 6: Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts. Additionally, among African American and Latino infants, mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher than other racial groups.\n\nParagraph 7: The success of AKAT-1 enabled Karpiński to be put forward by Poland as its candidate for the UNESCO worldwide award for young engineers in 1960. Karpiński's work was evaluated with around 200 other contestants by an UNESCO international committee, and he turned out to be among the six laureates. As a reward, he was allowed to go on a half-year scholarship in the United States to visit major technological centres in the country. During the scholarship, which has been eventually extended to a full year, Karpiński managed to visit around twenty universities and laboratories, among them Computation Laboratory at Harvard, Caltech, UCLA and Los Alamos National Laboratory. During his stay he met with a number of leading computer scientists of the time including John Eckert, Claude Shannon and Edward F. Moore. Despite the numerous offers to stay in the United States and move his work there, Karpiński decided to come back to Poland. Later, it emerged that before and during his stay in the United States, Karpiński cooperatated with Polish intelligence to collect data, which sparked controversies around his person. Karpiński himself, interviewed on the matter after the fall of communism, was reluctant to comment the matter, but insisted the agreement with intelligence officer cpt. Zygmunt Goć was limited to reporting on the state of technical progress of American facilities.\n\nParagraph 8: Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine gave Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love four and a half out of five stars, noticing that she has \"never sounded better\" with the release of the album. Keefe also mentioned that the album should receive recognition from country radio because \"more than half\" of the album's songs could be used as radio singles: \"Hopefully, Big Machine will make better choices in that regard than MCA did, because if country radio has any sense left at all, Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love should allow Yearwood to return to the top of the charts. It's a career-best effort from one of the genre's all-time greatest vocalists and a testament to the vitality, intelligence, and soulfulness of modern country's best music.\" The 9513's Jim Malec gave the release five out of five stars, calling the album in general \"breathtaking\". Malec noted that the difference between a \"good album\" and a \"great\" comes because the choice of material, saying that Yearwood recorded a \"great album\": \"The difference between a good album and a great album always–always–comes down to songs and song selection. And while Yearwood has long since proven herself a superb vocalist, her albums have, on occasion, tapped into a fair bit of par-for-the-coursematerial. That is not a problem here.\"Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love received four and a half out of five stars from Thom Jurek at Allmusic. Jurek mentioned in the conclusion of his review that the album went beyond expectations for a country album to go, stating \"The bottom line is this: Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love is, without a shadow of a doubt, the finest, most consistent and deeply moving (not to mention fun) record she has ever cut. It carries the mark of a bona fide artist who understands herself well enough to know that a great song is not only communicable but is communication itself to the listener.This time out, Yearwood is in a class by herself, and if country radio/video/television get involved at all, she'll hit it out of the park. It's better than good, it's beyond expectation -- and it was high after Jasper County -- it's the best example of what a popular record -- not just a country one -- should aspire to be, period.\" At the 51st Grammy Awards, Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love was nominated in the category for Best Country Album. In addition the second track \"This Is Me You're Talking To\" was nominated in the category for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the sixth track \"Let the Wind Chase You\" was nominated for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.\n\nParagraph 9: The organisation was founded in 1923 under the leadership of Docho Mihaylov and on the basis of the Great Convention of Dobruja (Велик добруджански събор), a Bulgarian political organisation established in 1919 to fight against Romanian rule in Southern Dobruja. The IDRO detachments fought against the widespread brigandage in the region, as well as the Romanian administration in the region. Like the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation in Macedonia and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation in Thrace, IDRO demanded political autonomy of Dobruja under the mandate of the League of Nations raising the slogan for the establishment of an \"autonomous Dobruja\" under the supervision of the League of Nations and \"Dobruja for the Dobrujans\".\n\nParagraph 10: After leaving school at the end of 1928 Fletcher joined the Old Boys club in Palmerston North. He began the season playing 4 games in their junior side before debuting for the senior team on 18 May in a 27–20 loss to Feilding Old Boys on the main Oval at the Palmerston North Showgrounds. He was heavily involved in the match and afterwards the Manawatu Times reported that he had been “borrowed for the day from the junior grade” and “was the one player who was consistently solid in defence and attack. His passing was excellent and his kicking judicious”. His first try for the senior side came a week later on 25 May against Woodville. He scored the first points of the match after receiving a pass from Riddell and “raced over” with the match finishing 3–3. He scored another try in a win over Feilding Old Boys on 1 June and the Manawatu Standard said that “Fletcher is a great asset to Old Boys’ back line and if he stands up to senior play he should make a name for himself in Manawhenua football. He set a good example to the other backs in falling back when Old Boys’ line was threatened”. He scored 3 more tries against Athletic on 8 June. He would finish the year having played 13 games for Old Boys, scoring 5 tries and kicking 3 conversions and a penalty. In mid June he was selected to play in a trial match for Manawatu A at Shannon against Horowhenua A. In this period in Manawatu's history they fielded an amalgamated representative side with Horowhenua known as Manawhenua. Fletcher played at centre and kicked 3 conversions in a 15–14 win. The two teams met again on 10 July at the Showgrounds with Horowhenua winning this time by 18 points to 14. Fletcher kicked a penalty and a conversion for the losers. Following the match he was chosen in the Manawhenua side to play Wairarapa on 17 July at centre. On his debut for Manawhenua at the Palmerston North Showgrounds Fletcher played well but Wairarapa won 12–10 after scoring a last minute try. The Horowhenua Chronicle made note of his play when they said “Fletcher was remarkably sound on defence, his tackling being performed in a capable and business-like manner that left his subjects under no misconception as to the solidity of Mother Earth. He did not shine so much on attack as is usually the case, but when it is considered that he was playing his first big representative match, and that he was up against unusually formidable opposition, this is easily understandable. On his game, the quothful Old Boys’ star has certainly consolidated his claims for continued consideration”."}

While serving as manager for the remaining 55 games, he rallied them to 37 wins that helped the team finish with a 90–64 record, finishing four games ahead of Pittsburgh for the National League pennant. This was the first pennant for the Cubs since 1929. In the 1932 World Series, they would be swept by the New York Yankees in four games. Grimm would retain the position of manager for the next seven seasons. In his first tenure as the Cubs manager, his teams would finish no worse than third place. In the two seasons after his first pennant, he led them to 86 wins each, which was good for third place. The 1935 season proved superior for Grimm and Cubs, as he led them to their first 100-win season in 25 years, made most memorable by a 21-game winning streak in the month of September. In the World Series that year against the Detroit Tigers, they won the first game in Detroit before losing the next three. They rallied to win Game 5 at Wrigley Field, but the Tigers won a walk-off hit from Goose Goslin to win 4–3 and seal the Series. The Cubs went 87–67 for a third place finish the following year (which was Grimm's last as a player-manager), but they improved to 93–61 and second place the year after. 1938 was his last season of his first tenure as manager of the Cubs. The team was 45–36 when owner P. K. Wrigley moved Grimm to the broadcast booth and named catcher Gabby Hartnett as player-manager. As Grimm had done six years earlier, Hartnett led the Cubs to a dramatic comeback to win the league pennant that season.\n\nParagraph 3: Returning home, the group realises that when projected onto Anaximander's Map of the Circular Earth (a copy of which exists in Valka Castle), the grooves in the Dragon Flute indicate a location in the Red Sea. R&R returns to investigate. The player identifies a large empty space beneath a long fissure, but it is blocked off by a thin bedrock wall at the end. Identifying metal in the wall, R&R realises it is something referred to in one of the tablets, and blows the wall up with dynamite; however, the player must wait until the next day to investigate further in order to allow the debris to settle. The following morning, at the player's suggestion, R&R wakes at dawn, when a large number of whales and dolphins are congregating in the area. The group swims through a tunnel and into a large cavern, where a huge temple is submerged. The group enters the temple, but find themselves sucked in by strong currents. Upon entering the temple, the group realises that the radio does not work, meaning they can no longer communicate with Jean-Eric. Exploring the temple, the group finds a series of altars. The player plays the Dragon Flute to several of them, but each time the currents change direction and whisk someone away. Eventually, everyone ends up back at the entrance, where the radio now works again. Following an inscription, it is discovered that one of the altars includes a metal symbol, which has been blocking the radio signal. GG turns it, opening a passageway through a subterranean chamber into another altar. The temple being symmetrical, the group eventually ends up at the foyer on the other side from the entrance. Following another inscription, the player presses a brick which opens the large central hall, above which is a smaller hall, which is locked. WHile GG looks for a mechanism, three goblin sharks, one of which is very large, enter and threaten the group, but they are driven away. GG finds the mechanism and opens the chamber, which is covered in heiroglyphs. Hayako interprets this as a mythologised history of the people who built the temple. When the Dragon Flute is played, the goblin sharks return, sealing the chamber. Hayako notes three statues around the room are the three forms of Ra. The player successfully calms the sharks and deposits the three parts of the flute in the statues, re-opening the chamber and driving the sharks away. At this point, an unknown species of whale enters, which looks something like a juvenile albino humpback whale. It and all the others of its species in the temple begin singing the Song of Dragons, which Oceana deduces is a product of echolocation. The group all turns a large wheel in the centre of the room, which causes all the whales in the area, inside and outside the temple, to bang their heads on the building, opening the treasure chamber. However, before the group can salvage it, they realise the temple will soon collapse and they must escape. Discovering a symmetrical hall on the other side of the chamber, the group attempts to escape, and, after receiving a message on the radio telling Oceana to use a mechanism in a crack next to an image of Set, they succeed. Jean-Eric explains that his signal was jammed, so the person on the radio couldn't have been him, and the group discuss their plans to reopen the temple, salvage the treasure and learn the true secrets of the people who built it.\n\nParagraph 4: South Africa has 11 national languages: , . Any definitive literary history of South Africa should, it could not be argued, discuss literature produced in all eleven languages. But the only literature ever to adopt characteristics that can be said to be \"national\" is kid. Olivier argues: \"Of all the literatures in South Africa, Afrikaans literature has been the only one to have become a national literature in the sense that it developed a clear image of itself as a separate entity, and that by way of institutional entrenchment through teaching, distribution, a review culture, journals, etc. it could ensure the continuation of that concept.\" Part of the problem is that English literature has been seen within the greater context of English writing in the world, and has, because of English's global position as ', not been seen as autonomous or indigenous to South Africa – in Olivier’s words: \"English literature in South Africa continues to be a sort of extension of British or international English literature.\" The African languages, on the other hand, are spoken across the borders of Southern Africa - for example, Tswana is spoken in Botswana, and in Zimbabwe, and in Lesotho. South Africa's borders were drawn up by the British Empire and, as with all other colonies, these borders were drawn without regard for the people living within them. Therefore: in a history of South African literature, do we include all Tswana writers, or only the ones with South African citizenship? Chapman bypasses this problem by including \"Southern\" African literatures. The second problem with the African languages is accessibility, because since the African languages are regional languages, none of them can claim the readership on a national scale comparable to Afrikaans and English. Sotho, for instance, while transgressing the national borders of the RSA, is on the other hand mainly spoken in the Free State, and bears a great amount of relation to the language of for example, Zulu. So the language cannot claim a national readership, while on the other hand being \"international\" in the sense that it transgresses the national borders.Olivier argues that \"There is no obvious reason why it should be unhealthy or abnormal for different literatures to co-exist in one country, each possessing its own infrastructure and allowing theoreticians to develop impressive theories about polysystems\". Yet political idealism proposing a unified \"South Africa\" (a remnant of the colonial British approach) has seeped into literary discourse and demands a unified national literature, which does not exist and has to be fabricated. It is unrealistic to ever think of South Africa and South African literature as homogenous, now or in the near or distant future, since the only reason it is a country at all is the interference of European colonial powers. This is not a racial issue, but rather has to do with culture, heritage and tradition (and indeed the constitution celebrates diversity). Rather, it seems more sensible to discuss South African literature as literature produced within the national borders by the different cultures and language groups inhabiting these borders. Otherwise the danger is emphasising one literary system at the expense of another, and more often than not, the beneficiary is English, with the African languages being ignored. The distinction \"black\" and \"white\" literature is further a remnant of colonialism that should be replaced by drawing distinctions between literary systems based on language affiliation rather than race.\n\nParagraph 5: It was announced in 2017, NEMCO Motorsports would be fielding a 2nd truck driven by Joe Nemechek in the No. 87 Fleetwing Chevrolet, the first time a father and son competed in a truck series race since Dave Blaney and Ryan Blaney at Eldora in 2013. After finishing 29th, 28th, 22nd, and 21st at the beginning of the season, John Hunter Nemechek got his 1st win of the season at Gateway, he followed that up with a win at Iowa the very next race. Joe and John Hunter will split the 8 now that the younger Nemechek has moved to a partial schedule driving for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Xfinity Series. Financial problems hit the team in 2019, forcing the 8 to start and park several races when John Hunter was not entered, or Joe was unable to find sufficient sponsorship. 2020 saw the 8s schedule greatly reduced as both teams, the 8 and 87, missed the show at Daytona with John Hunter and Joe. The #8 attempted five more races, one with Mike Skeen, one with Joe Nemechek  and the other three with JH Nemechek. He scored a top-10 finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway, climbing all the way from 38th to 6th by the end of the event. Skeen finished 23rd at the Daytona Road Course, while Joe Nemechek finished 37th at Talladega after an early crash eliminated him. Rumors circulated that NEMCO had no plans of attempting any races in 2021. These were later debunked by Joe Nemechek, who shared on his Instagram that he would attempt the season opening race at Daytona. Despite not making the race, NEMCO would run the second race of the season with Camden Murphy, finishing 13th. Following the Daytona Road Course Race, NEMCO sold its owner points to the no. 11 Spencer Davis Motorsports team.\n\nParagraph 6: Boll made headlines by challenging his critics to \"put up or shut up\". In June 2006, his production company issued a press release stating that Boll would challenge his five harshest critics each to a 10-round boxing match. Invitations were also open to film directors Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. To qualify, critics had to have written two extremely negative reviews of Boll, in print or on the Web. In 2005, footage from the fights were to be included on the DVD of his upcoming film Postal. On 20 June 2006, Rich \"Lowtax\" Kyanka stated on Something Awful that he had been invited by Boll to be the first contestant, after Kyanka reviewed Alone in the Dark. The online gambling site GoldenPalace.com decided to sponsor this event, dubbing it \"Raging Boll\" (a play on the 1980 Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull). A lot was drawn up in late August 2006, featuring Kyanka, Rue Morgue magazine writer Chris Alexander, webmaster of Cinecutre Carlos Palencia Jimenez-Arguello, Ain't it Cool News writer Jeff Sneider, and Chance Minter, amateur boxer and website critic. Boll fought and won against all five participants. The first match took place on 5 September 2006 in Estepona, Spain, against Carlos Palencia. The others battled on 23 September 2006, at the Plaza of Nations in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nParagraph 7: Beulah Park was owned in part or whole from 1923 to May 1983, sixty years, by the Robert Dienst Family.  Robert J. Dienst owned and operated the track until his death on August 19, 1959. Robert J. Dienst was most famous for the 1956 and 1957 American Champion Sprint Horse, Decathlon. Robert J. was a bit of a showboat and made gambling fun to the public. After his death, his son, Robert Y. Dienst who was conservative, took over and rebuilt the track, especially the backside when a fire broke out circa 1959. He poured the profits right back into the track, making it a showplace, not just for the general public but for the horsemen. Around 1959, an all wood barn with 40 horses perished in a night time blaze. Because of this, Robert Y. Dienst built almost all concrete block with tin roof barns from then on—having a full-time construction crew just for that purpose.  Horsemen and Horsewomen appreciated the care that was taken towards their horses.  Robert Y. was a true horseman and loved the sport just for the sport's sake. He had a small stable, River Divide Farm, of about a dozen horses that he raced with the guidance of Trainer & Starter Don Rose up until his death on Nov. 7, 1996 (when Robert Y. was hours shy of his 80th birthday).  Robert Y. Dienst's son, \"Bob M.\" Dienst, left working at Beulah in the Spring of 1981 because of a management style disagreement with the then general manager, Mr. Houser (this was during 1981). Bob M. Dienst now resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico doing real estate. Robert Y. Dienst's son-in-law, Thomas E. Heinl worked in charge of Parimutuels (from 1975 to 1986) -- computerizing the Totalization equipment, the first to do so in the eastern part of the United States.  Tom Heinl revolutionized the way parimutuel tickets are sold even today.\n\nParagraph 8: Pachycephalosaurs were bipedal ornithischians characterized by their thickened skulls. They had a bulky torso with an expanded gut cavity and broad hips, short forelimbs, long legs, a short, thick neck, and a heavy tail. Large orbits and a large optic nerve point to pachycephalosaurs having good vision, and uncharacteristically large olfactory lobes indicate that they had a good sense of smell relative to other dinosaurs. They were fairly small dinosaurs, with most falling in the range of 2–3 meters (6.6-9.8 feet) in length and the largest, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, estimated to measure 4.5 meters (14.8 feet) long and weigh 450 kilograms (990 pounds). The characteristic skull of pachycephalosaurs is a result of the fusion and thickening of the frontals and parietals, accompanied by the closing of the supratemporal fenestra. In some species this takes the form of a raised dome; in others, the skull is flat or wedge-shaped. While the flat-headed pachycephalosaurs are traditionally regarded as distinct species or even families, they may represent juveniles of dome-headed adults.[2][3] All display highly ornamented jugals, squamosals, and postorbitals in the form of blunt horns and nodes. Many species are only known from skull fragments, and a complete pachycephalosaur skeleton is yet to be found.\n\nParagraph 9: Khambatta made her Bollywood début in director K. A. Abbas's Bambai Raat Ki Bahon Mein (1968), playing cabaret singer Lily who croons the film's title track. She had small roles in Conduct Unbecoming and The Wilby Conspiracy (both 1975). She went on to have a brief movie career that included the role for which she is most recognized, the bald Deltan navigator Lieutenant Ilia, in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). She shaved her head for the role. She was originally signed to play the role for five years, as the intention was to create a new Star Trek television series. Khambatta said that she was thrilled when the project became a movie instead, because it would have greater impact on her career, but she also recognised that she had lost five years' work. Khambatta became the first Indian citizen to present an Academy Award in 1980. She was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her role in Star Trek. This led to roles in Nighthawks (1981), Megaforce (1982), Warrior of the Lost World (1983), and She-Wolves of the Wasteland (1988). She was considered for the title role in the James Bond film Octopussy (1983), but was passed over in favor of Maud Adams.\n\nParagraph 10: Two young BMX experts, P. J. and Goose, meet Judy, who is working as a trolley collector at the Warringah Mall during the school holidays in order to be able to buy her own BMX bike, and accidentally get Judy fired from her job when they crash into trolleys pushed away by the local \"Creep\". The three go out in Goose's dad's runabout on the harbour searching for cockles to sell in order to fix their own crashed bikes, as well as getting Judy her own, and stumble onto and steal a box of police-band walkie talkies that the bank robbers were hoping to use to monitor on police traffic. After stealing the box, the kids pass Whitey and Moustache who are on their way in their high-powered motorboat to pick it up."}

In addition to writing plays, including The Vicarage, The Cape Mail, Anne Mié, Odette, and The Great Divorce Case, Scott also adapted plays by Victorien Sardou and Halévy and Meilhac. His collaborations with B. C. Stephenson were particularly successful, with their adaptation of Dora receiving acclaim and playing in both London and New York. Scott and Stephenson also adapted a libretto for Lecocq's operetta Le Petit Duc, impressing the composer enough that he agreed to write new music for the English production. Scott used the pseudonym \"Saville Rowe\" for these works. In addition to his theatrical writing, Scott wrote about his travel experiences, which influenced his creative writing. It is also mentioned that he may have written the tune to the \"Swiss Cradle Song,\" later adapted as \"Now Is the Hour\" and as \"Haere Ra,\" a Maori farewell song.

They began with a draw against Kerala Blasters, with both teams scoring one goal each. Mumbai then faced Chennaiyin and secured a 1-0 victory, ending Chennaiyin's winning streak. The team went on to defeat ATK 1-0, with ATK's goal coming from a shot deflected by Mumbai's Robin. In their match against NorthEast United, Mumbai won 2-0 with Balwant Singh scoring both goals. The month ended with Mumbai routing Delhi Dynamos 4-0, with goals from Lucian Goian, Everton Santos, and Balwant Singh.

Mark Sifneos’ goal in the first half, which was also Kerala's first of the season, was cancelled out by Balwant Singh's strike in the second. C.K. Vineeth was booked a second time in the 90th minute following a tussle with Balwant, and was consequently given his marching orders. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. After a poor start to the season with 1 win, 1 draw and 2 losses, Mumbai City next faced Chennaiyin, who were on a 3 match winning run on 10 December 2017. Mumbai were awarded a penalty after Balwant Singh was brought down in the box. Emana stepped up to the spot and slotted the ball into the bottom left corner to make it 1-0 for the Islanders, thus scoring the only goal of the game and breaking Chennaiyin's winning streak and securing their 2nd win of the season. Mumbai City then hosted previous seasons' champion ATK on 17 December, who were still winless this season. Amrinder made a couple of good saves to deny ATK a goal. His and Mumbai's resistance finally came to an end in the 54th minute when Zequinha hit a shot with the outside of his right foot from the left flank. The keeper was unsighted by Robin, who got a slight touch on the ball to help it through Amrinder's legs and into the net. Mumbai then won an away game against NorthEast United on 20 December, after Balwant scored a brace by scoring on either sides of half-time to ensure a 2-0 win for the Islanders. In their last game of the year 2017, Mumbai City routed Delhi Dynamos, courtesy a 4–0 scoreline at the Mumbai Football Arena. Lucian Goian and Everton Santos struck in the first half to give Mumbai City a 2 goal cushion. The half, however, ended on a sour note as a tussle between Mumbai's Sehnaj Singh and Delhi's Mirabaje earned both a straight red. The second half started with 20 players on the pitch and it took only four minutes for the home team to score their third. Eleven minutes from time, Emana found Balwant with a lovely chip, who chested the ball down and hit a scuffed shot off his calf, that wrong-footed Arnab to roll over the goal-line, thus adding a fourth goal to Delhi's misery.\n\nParagraph 3: At The Seven Arts magazine he served as primary editor and worked with Waldo Frank, George Jean Nathan, Louis Untermeyer and Paul Rosenfeld from 1916–17, until he was blacklisted due to his opposition to US entry into World War I. James Oppenheim later wrote a reminiscence of his one tumultuous year as editor of the journal in which he observed that Randolph Bourne \"was the real leader... of what brains and creativeness we had at the time and had he lived the 'twenties might have sparkled much more than they did. Mind you, this young man not only was a cripple, but wheezed in breathing, and was mortally physically afraid most of the time. More than that, he had one fear greater than any other. That was the fear of prison. He could hardly bear the thought of it.\"  However, Bourne wrote six anti-war articles for the magazine in the teeth of these frailties and fears. Then \"the air began to get hot, pro and con, mainly pro,\" but Oppenheim also found himself the object of surveillance. \"The illusion of a 'free country' in which I had grown up simply exploded. It was something in those days to know one was shadowed, spied upon, trailed by snoopers, that one must whisper what one thought in a restaurant and even then be sure one's friend wasn't going to hand one over to the police.... The lying propaganda had something foul and degrading in it. The exultation of the timorous stay-at-homes was rotten and debased. 'Enemies Within,' shrieked the old New York Tribune and spat snake's venom at Bourne and the rest of us.\" The circulation was actually climbing when \"the inevitable happened. The contract stipulated that there should be no interference from the business side. However, our backer, clerking still [i.e., the rich backer worked as a clerk to dispel her boredom], was mortally terrified not only by the danger we found ourselves in, but by the word treason. She was of good old American stock, and besides, relatives of hers owned a great food industry. They pressed her hard. She came to me and said we would have to lay off the war, or there would be no more subsidy. There was no more subsidy. . . . But I wouldn’t have missed that year for kingdom come.\"\n\nParagraph 4: The main exploration started officially when a cooperative contract signed on September 17, 2005, with Mobil Cepu Ltd., a subsidiary of ExxonMobil as main operator. A joint operation agreement between state oil company Pertamina was signed in March 2006. Pertamina and ExxonMobil concluded a 30-year production-sharing contract in which each company would share 45 percent interest in the block. The remaining 10 percent would go to the local governments. Foreign companies, mainly from China, have started to invest in Bojonegoro in various projects related with the planned exploration and exploitation of the Cepu Block oil fields with total value of US$8 million. According to the former minister and ambassador to the United States, Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Tuban and Bojonegoro would resemble Texas, because of its gas and oil resources.\n\nParagraph 5: In 2015 Grant took part in a public debate at the IQ2 stage of The Ethics Centre, with immigration lawyer Pallavi Sinha, Herald Sun columnist Rita Panahi and actor Jack Thompson to argue for or against the topic \"Racism is destroying the Australian dream\". He told of the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians, past and present. He argued that \"the Australian Dream\" was based upon racism, mentioning his ancestors and others who were forced into institutions and unpaid work. The debate itself was a finalist in the United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Awards for \"its role in stimulating public awareness and understanding\".\n\nParagraph 6: In the series against Colorado, Cal came knocking on the door and forced the game to 5 sets, but ended up losing despite stellar performances from Pantovic and Lilomaiava. It didn't help that libero Tara Desa had gone on COVID protocol and that starting libero Lexi Gruszczynski and backup setter Blevins were injured. The team could not replicate their efforts in the second game, losing 3–0, as errors and poor hitting efficiency doomed the Bears, who were unable to stop the Buffs' Elissa Alcantara and Sterling Parker. Aside from Lilomaiava's 7 kills, everyone else did not do that well, a sign that losing Mirkovic was going to make it hard for them to replicate their 2019 success. On February 12, 2021, Cal managed to beat a depleted Stanford team in Haas in 5 sets behind Pantovic's first double-double (16 kills, 11 digs) and Bergmark's .348 hitting percentage for their first win of the season and their first win vs Stanford since 2011. They could not complete the sweep two days later, losing in straight sets to split the series with the Cardinal due to poor defense and Stanford's blocking prowess. The USC series, despite being a hard-fought one, resulted in 3–1 losses both times for the Bears, dropping them further down the standings. In the series against Washington State, the Bears were swept both times, dropping to 1–11 on the season despite having an overall winning record against the Cougars. Though they fought hard both times, the WSU block stifled Cal despite Grote's 11 kills in the second game, proving that Cal's NCAA hopes seemed all but impossible. To make matters worse, Potter injured her left hand in the second game of the series while going up for a block, leaving her unable to set, and Bellizzi was also injured in the first game of the series as well, forcing fellow libero Jessica Houghton to take over at the position. Potter's absence forced freshman Kendall Jensen to take the reins at setter and the Bears suffered uncharacteristic losses (3–2 in game 1 and 3–0 in game 2) to the OSU Beavers, a team they have a winning record against, despite strong performances by Grote in both games. Pantovic recorded her second double-double in the first game, but had only 6 kills and 7 digs in the second to go with her first solo block, and Lilomaiava's poor performance in game 2 of the series didn't help their cause. The series vs the ASU Sun Devils wasn't much better despite Grote's 13 kills in the second game, resulting in 3–0 sweep losses both times. Pantovic did uncharacteristically poor in both games, and Lilomaiava struggled to find consistency offensively, which did not help despite her improved blocking numbers.\n\nParagraph 7: Five-time Wimbledon winner, defending champion and World No. 1 Roger Federer advanced to the tournament's quarterfinals for the seventh time in ten participations past former World No. 1 and 2002 Wimbledon titlist Lleyton Hewitt after less than two hours of play, on the score of 7–6(7), 6–2, 6–4, while second seed, 2006 and 2007 finalist Rafael Nadal left no hopes to seventeenth seed Mikhail Youzhny, as he defeated the Russian 6–3, 6–3, 6–1. 2004 Wimbledon semifinalist and ATP No. 43 Mario Ančić was led two-sets-to-love by Nottingham finalist and twenty-second seed Fernando Verdasco, when he started a comeback, winning the third set, and overcoming Verdasco's 4–1 lead to take the fourth, to ultimately win the match, after the two players repeatedly broke each other in the one-hour-and-half-long fifth set, on the final score of 3–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 13–11, after nearly four hours of play, and set a rematch of the 2006 Wimbledon quarterfinal against Federer. Thirty-first-seeded Feliciano López climbed back from being led two-sets-to-one, and saved three match points, the third one with an ace on his second service, to finally beat tenth seed, 2006 semifinalist and 2007 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Marcos Baghdatis after almost four hours of play, 5–7, 6–2, 3–6, 7–6(4), 8–6. In the first fourth round match involving two unseeded players, ATP No. 94 and 2003 Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schüttler dominated ATP No. 40, victor of Andy Roddick, Serbian Janko Tipsarević 6–3, 3–6, 6–4, 7–6(4), and in the second one, 2001 Australian Open runner-up and 2007 Wimbledon doubles champion, ATP No. 145 Arnaud Clément outplayed nineteen-year-old Croatian, ATP No. 55 Marin Čilić, in straight sets 6–3, 7–5, 6–2. Former World No. 1 Marat Safin eliminated a third consecutive seed in the tournament, as he beat Rome Masters finalist Stan Wawrinka for the first time in three encounters, on the score of 6–4, 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, to match his best result in Wimbledon, a 2001 quarterfinal. Eighth seed, 2007 Wimbledon semifinalist, Frenchman Richard Gasquet entirely dominated his adversary, twelfth seed, British Andy Murray during two sets, and up to the end of the third one, when he served to win the match, before Murray broke the Frenchman back and won the set's tie-break, eventually taking back the control of the encounter, racing through the fourth set and breaking early in the fifth to win, in almost complete darkness, at 21:30 (UTC+1), after four hours of play, on the score of 5–7, 3–6, 7–6(3), 6–2, 6–4, and, reaching his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, complete the round of eight line up.\n\nParagraph 8: As well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including The Vicarage, The Cape Mail, Anne Mié, Odette, and The Great Divorce Case. He wrote several English adaptations of Victorien Sardou's plays, some of which were written in collaboration with B. C. Stephenson, such as Nos intimes (as Peril) and Dora (1878, as Diplomacy). The latter was described by the theatrical paper The Era as \"the great dramatic hit of the season\". It also played with success at Wallack's Theatre in New York. Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of Halévy and Meilhac's libretto for Lecocq's operetta Le Petit Duc (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production. For all these, Scott adopted the pen name \"Saville Rowe\" (after Savile Row) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, \"Bolton Rowe\", another Mayfair street. The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the Bancrofts, the producers of T. W. Robertson's plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the British Isles and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the \"Swiss Cradle Song\", later adapted as \"Now Is the Hour\" and as \"Haere Ra\", the Māori farewell song, which white New Zealanders \"mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong\". It is also used for the hymn \"Search Me, O God\", with lyrics by J. Edwin Orr. However, an Australian family has long claimed that the \"Clement Scott\" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.\n\nParagraph 9: The town has a Hall with public toilets, a post office in one of the front rooms of the Yeelanna Hall, grain silos that were built in the 1960s and a railway line that has been their since around 1908 and transported  grain to Port Lincoln for export until 2018 when all grain transportation on Eyre Peninsula went by Road Train,  fourteen houses, a Uniting Church, a CFS brigade, an Agriculture Bureau that has existed since 1908 that is the Yeelanna/Karkoo Ag Bureau that has their meetings at the Kooplex at Karkoo, a Country  Woman's Association, a museum called Bellewood Museum, and a historic cemetery. The town  has a table tennis club, that plays its home matches in the Yeelanna Hall, and was established in 1939 and were Great Flinders table tennis association Premiers in 2019,back to back premiers in 06/07 and in 2007 were undefeated Premiers. Yeelanna Football club was formed in 1909 and the Netball club in about 1934 and amalgamated with the United(Karkoo and Murdinga area) football and netball clubs in 1964 to form the United Yeelanna Football and Netball clubs.  The amalgamated club kept using the blue and gold Yeelanna colours.  Yeelanna football and netball clubs played at three home ground's being Murdinga, Karkoo and Yeelanna. They stopped playing at Murdinga in 1974 and Yeelanna at the end of the 1994 season. In 2014  United Yeelanna won the football Premierships in the A,B and colts (under 16's) grades, and in the netball won the Premierships in the  A-Reserves, and B-grade and in 2015 and 2016 United Yeelanna's football clubs A grade won Premierships to win three Premierships in a row and United Yeelanna's netball clubs A- Reserves won Premierships in 2015 and 2016 as well to also win three Premierships in a row. Yeelanna cricket club formed in about 1911 and amalgamated with Karkoo in around 2000/01 to become the Karkoo/Yeelanna cricket club. The amalgamated  club used the blue and gold Yeelanna colours and stopped playing at Yeelanna in around 03/04. The Karkoo/Yeelanna cricket club were undefeated premiers in 2016/17 season their first premiership as a merged club. Yeelanna tennis club formed in the early days of the township and had a team until the late 1980s, that then folded and the Yeelanna players joined with neighbouring  club at Karkoo. The Yeelanna colours have been merged in with the Karkoo tennis club, reflecting the area the Karkoo tennis club represents, with many Yeelanna people playing for the Karkoo tennis club, with Karkoo Blue winning back to back premierships in 2013/14 2014/15 seasons and Karkoo were premiers in 2016/17\n\nParagraph 10: The history of Rare Bird began when Graham Field placed an advertisement for a pianist in a musical periodical. He got thirty replies and formed a group called \"Lunch\". He met Dave Kaffinetti in November 1968, and together they formulated the basic ideas for Rare Bird. In August 1969, they finally found the ideal rhythm section in Steve Gould, Chris Randall and Mark Ashton. Field and Kaffinetti had originally envisaged that the band would be a four-piece and were looking for a singer/bass player. Steve and Chris, who had both previously been members of the Pop-Psych band \"Fruit Machine\", applied to the ad as vocals/guitar and bass respectively and were taken on. Lunch played a few gigs, one notable one was at the Tilbury Working Mens Club for the princely sum of five pounds. The band had no van and they managed to get amps, drums, guitars and Hammond organ into their cars. The gig was marred by Chris receiving a bad electric shock whilst on stage. It later turned out that the founders of the band were more interested in Steve and convinced him to play bass. Chris was now high and dry and was kicked out of the band. Two weeks later, they had signed management and agency contracts, and three weeks later, were in the studio recording their debut album. Before joining Lunch, Randall and Gould had previously written a song called \"To the Memory of Two Brave Dogs\". Rare Bird included this song in their debut album renaming it \"Iceberg\" but Randall received no credit on the L.P."}

Consulting a wizard, he learns that the corridors of time are being held open, causing harm to his future father-in-law. Determined to find the culprit, Godefroy embarks on a mission. In the present day, two characters named Jacquouille and Ginete rob a supermarket and eventually end up working for Beatrice. Beatrice's husband, Jean-Pierre, a dentist, scares away his patients, leading Beatrice to allow Jacquouille to watch TV, which he believes is the work of Satan and destroys. Jacquart, another character, is tortured by the Inquisition. Godefroy intervenes to stop the torture and admits to Burning Jacquart's Range Rover. Jacquouille and Ginette receive a potion from Beatrice that sends them back to the year 1123 where they help Godefroy fight invaders. They discover that Jacquouille has stolen the Duke's treasure, and the remaining items are in the future, keeping the corridors of time open. They return to their own time, terrorize a hotel, and retrieve the stolen jewels from Jacqouille's ex-wife.

Their family went through difficult times during this period, and eventually, they left their father and moved to live with their grandmother. The author admits to having resentments towards their father for not being present, but they also started to think about his perspective and what he might have gone through. The author then used music as an outlet to express these thoughts and emotions, ultimately creating a song that deeply resonated with their father.

The fame of Sarbiewski is as wide as the world of letters. He was gifted with remarkable general talent, especially in music and the fine arts, but his chief excellence was as a poet versed in all the metres of the ancients. He was especially devoted to Horace, whose Odes he knew by heart. He also made the lyrical poetry of Pindar his own. To his familiarity with these great poets he added an industry which has given the splendid yield of his poetic works. The latest edition of these, printed at Stara Wieś in 1892, embraces four books of lyrics, a book of epodes, his posthumous Silviludia (Woodland Notes), and his book of epigrams. Of all these the lyrics furnish the best example of his qualities of mind and heart. All are pitched in a high key of thought, sentiment, or passion. His themes are for the most part love and devotion for Christ Crucified, for Our Blessed Lady, or friendship for a noble patron, such as Bishop Łubieński, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, nephew to Urban VIII, and that pontiff himself, whom he hailed as his Maecenas in several odes of exquisite finish. His noblest and most sustained efforts, however, are his patriotic odes upon the fatherland, the Knights of Poland, and kindred subjects. His tenderest pieces are those in praise of the rose, the violet, and the grasshopper, in which he rivals the grace and happy touch of Horace himself. He was crowned poeta laureatus by King Władysław IV Vasa. Urban VIII named him one of the revisers of the hymns of the Breviary, and he in particular is credited with having softened their previous ruggedness of metre. Some critics have urged that in his love of Horace he went so far as to become servile in imitating him, while others again have made a very virtue out of this close imitation. As a religious he was noted for his love of solitude, turning from the attractions of court life to solitude, prayer, and useful study and occupation.\n\nParagraph 2: By 22:24, the impact of the disaster on the left was apparent, so all plans to resume the Operation Dauntless attack the next day were abruptly canceled. Units along the forward edge of the battlefield were placed on full alert. Commanders hurriedly sent out combat patrols to locate the enemy and to try fix his line of march, while the Marines at the Main line of resistance dug in deep and nervously checked their weapons. In addition, General Oliver P. Smith ordered Colonel Robley E. West's 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, up from Chuncheon to tie in with the artillery and tanks located in the valley on the far west flank. West's battalion was soon on trucks headed for its new position, but the convoy could only creep along over roads choked with panic-stricken ROK soldiers escaping the battle zone. Captain John F. Coffey's Company B led the way. At about 01:30, while still  short of its assigned position, the long column of vehicles stopped at the tight perimeter formed by the 92nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion, which a short time before had established a roadblock, collected more than 1,800 ROK, and attempted by machine gun and bayonet with little success to deploy them to slow the PVA advance. Moving west, Coffey's company assisted in the extricating the 987th Artillery's 105mm howitzers that were stuck in the mud. After as many guns as possible were freed, Coffey returned to friendly lines where the 1st Battalion was manning a wooded semi-circular ridge with Company A on the right, Company C in the center, and the 81mm mortars of Weapons Company on relatively level ground in the immediate rear. Company B was promptly assigned the battalion left flank. The PVA began probing Marine lines around 23:00 on 22 April and then mounted an all-out assault to turn the Marine flanks about three hours later. The 7th Marine Regiment on the left was the hardest hit unit. PVA mortar, automatic weapons, and small arms fire began at about 02:00 on the 23rd. This reconnaissance by fire was followed by a very determined ground assault an hour later. Shrieking whistles, clanging cymbals, and blasting bugles signaled the onslaught. At least 2,000 PVA troops hit the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, full force. That attack by the PVA 358th Regiment, 120th Division, primarily directed at Company C and Company A, was repulsed by hand-to-hand fighting that lasted almost until dawn. Private First Class Herbert A. Littleton, a radioman with the forward observer team attached to Company C, was standing the mid-watch when the PVA appeared. He sounded the alarm then moved to an exposed position from which he adjusted supporting arms fires despite fierce incoming machine gun fire and showers of PVA grenades. Forced back into a bunker by enemy fire, Littleton threw himself upon a grenade to save his comrades in that crowded space at the cost of his own life. He was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for his actions that night. Heavy fighting—much of it grenade duels and close quarters combat—lasted several hours. PVA mortar fire and small arms continued throughout the night and into the next day. As always, supporting arms were a critical Marine advantage. The 11th Marine Regiment ringed the endangered position with artillery fire, and Marine tanks successfully guarded the lowland approaches. In the division's center, PVA infiltrators silently slipped through the 5th Marines’ outpost line to occupy Hill 313. A futile counterattack was quickly launched, but the assault platoon was held in check and suffered heavy casualties. It was not until the next morning that elements of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 5th Marines, retook the hill.\n\nParagraph 3: That experience in Vietnam changed him [his father] forever, and it certainly had an effect on our family, so I guess it was a defining moment in my life, too. He didn’t walk out on us. We left him. It was an environment that wasn’t good for anyone, so we took off to live with my grandmother in Washington, and that’s where I went to school. I didn’t have a lot of my father around, but I started thinking about him a lot during that period. I certainly had resentments, as any young person does in a situation where a parent isn’t around or a family is split. But on Rooster, I was trying to think about his side of it – what he might have gone through. To be honest, I didn’t really sit down intending to do any of that; it just kinda came out. But that’s the great thing about music – sometimes it can reach deeper than you ever would in a conversation with anybody. It’s more of a forum to dig deeper. It felt like a major achievement for me as a young writer. When I first played it to my father, I asked him if I’d got close to where he might have been emotionally or mentally in that situation. And he told me: ‘You got too close – you hit it on the head'. It meant a lot to him that I wrote it. It brought us closer. It was good for me in the long-run and it was good for him, too.\n\nParagraph 4: The 4 silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century. located at the British Museum in London, all show the eagle with his head facing the right wing (as shown in the show we are publishing). The silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC, located in the Numismatic Museum in Athens, show the eagle looking to his right wing. In DH's book. Economet \"Pontus and his Dikaia in this Hellenism\", printed in Athens in 1920, and on page 146, the eagle of Sinopi's coin in the 4th century BC, has the eagle to look to his right feather. In David Talbot Rice's book \"The Church of Hagia Sophia at Trebizond\" published in 1968 in England, and on page 118, there is the full fresco painting of Emperor Manuel I who founded Hagia Sophia in Trebizond around 1250. This fresco, in normal size, was located in Hagia Sophia until 1850. Since then it has disappeared. In this fresco and the royal garments of the Emperor Manuel I there are over 15 eagles with their heads facing their right wing. All volumes of the Pontus archive have on the cover a coin of Sinope in the 4th century BC, showing the eagle's head tilted to the right of the wing. In 1961, titled \"1461–1961 Memory of Empire of Great Komnenos\" of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, the eagles are inclined to their right shoulders. The seal and the briefcases of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, since its foundation (1927), have the eagle facing the right wing. The Eagle of the Komnenoi of Trebizond at the Pontian Hero in Kallithea, Athens, looks towards its right wing.\n\nParagraph 5: Coincidentally, the fixture table was such that both clubs met directly at the first match day. At Munich Olympic Stadium, Kaiserslautern achieved a surprising 1–0 away win. After another win (1–0 against Hertha BSC) they were at the top of the league table after matchday two. They regained this top position after matchday four and eventually stayed there until the end of the season. After the end of the first half of the season, Kaiserslautern was four points ahead of Bayern, and while it was expected by many that the second direct encounter at Fritz-Walter-Stadion would be the start of an eventual change at the top, FCK again beat Bayern, this time 2–0, resulting in a seven-point margin between the two teams after matchday 18. Remarkable matchdays in terms of who would win the championship included round 23 and 24, when Bayern lost two matches in a row, while FCK managed to collect four points. Bayern never overtook Kaiserslautern during the whole season, and after matchday 33, with FCK beating VfL Wolfsburg 4–0 at home while Bayern only achieving a 0–0 draw at MSV Duisburg, Kaiserslautern were the early champions, with four points ahead with only one match remaining. They were the first team in Bundesliga history to win the championship as a newly promoted team.\n\nParagraph 6: Each of the symbols on the Wheel represents one of the Racing Realms, inter-dimensional worlds that have tracks that go through a single element in the hardest way possible for driving conditions (there are only fifteen Realms in the series, twelve that were actually shown and three that the Drones had already completed before the beginning of the series, but only the AcceleChargers from those three are shown). The Drones have been entering the Realms, and each time a Realm is finished, the first driver to reach the end of the track obtains an AcceleCharger, which gives a car the ability to drive through any condition that relates to the realm that it was won in. Discovering that the Wheel hologram is always in sync with the actual Wheel, it functions as an inter-dimensional portal to the Racing Realms (it should also be noted that the Drones have their own Wheel hologram portal as well, due to them capturing the actual Wheel). The drivers enter the realms to try to stop the Drones but find it harder than the World Race because the Wheel itself decides when to open the Realms and that each Realm only stays open for one hour with no way out but the finish line.\n\nParagraph 7: At the beginning of the 21st century, following the first decade of operations as a master's level university, graduate programs at Brenau represented a small percentage of the student body. By 2010 it was clear the demand for graduate studies would increase and, by 2025, graduate students at Brenau would represent more than half the student population. Thus, the university created the Sidney O. Smith Jr. Graduate School to place focused attention on the needs of graduate students. Graduate studies at the university include programs based on campus, online programs, and a mix of online and on-campus classes. In November 2010 the institution's accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, approved Brenau University's application to become a Level V doctoral degree-granting institution, paving the way for Brenau to launch a Doctor of Nursing Practice program in August 2011. A year earlier Brenau launched its first terminal degree program, a Master of Fine Arts in Interior Design. The first cohort of the Doctor of Occupational Therapy program started in 2014 and a Doctor of Physical Therapy Program began in 2015. The graduate school also offers a wide array of master's-level programs as well as education specialist graduate degrees.\n\nParagraph 8: During the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the queen. Febre forces the queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu finally realizes just how far Febre is willing to go: he means to start a war between France, England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing that he has lost control of his chief henchman, Richelieu secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. D'Artagnan agrees, but only because Febre is holding Francesca. D'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the crown remains their highest priority, and they join him at the castle where Francesca, the queen, and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process, but the diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. This enables him to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.\n\nParagraph 9: The Stallions began the fourth quarter with McGough's first pass attempt of the contest, which was intended for Bolden but fell incomplete. Scarbrough rushed for five yards on the next play but another incomplete pass from McGough forced Birmingham to attempt a 38-yard field goal, which was missed by Aubrey; this gave the Stars possession of the ball from their own 28-yard-line, the spot at which the kick was taken. A roughing the passer penalty and a 9-yard pass from Cookus to Rowland quickly moved Philadelphia into their opponent's territory, and they continued to move the ball with an 11-yard pass from Cookus to Bug Howard. Williams rushed for 14 yards to set the Stars up at the Birmingham 23-yard-line, but Cookus was sacked by Willie Yarbary on the next play for a loss of six yards. A defensive personal foul moved Philadelphia into the red zone soon afterwards, and Cookus found Gray in the end zone for a touchdown two plays later. The Stars attempted a two-point conversion, which was scored by Suell on a reception. This gave Philadelphia a 23–20 lead, their first of the game. Birmingham started their next drive at their own 22-yard-line and moved the ball quickly, with gains of 9, 11, and 15 yards on their first three plays. On first down at the Stars' 43-yard-line, McGough's pass was intercepted by Jordan Moore—the first turnover of the game—and returned to the Stars' 47-yard-line, giving Philadelphia a chance to increase their lead. They were unable to, however, going three-and-out and punting. The last of these three plays saw Cookus sacked by Dondrea Tillman, which injured Cookus (ultimately causing a broken fibula) and saw him exit the game. The Stallions resumed possession at their own 36-yard-line and found themselves in Stars territory in two plays. Later, on first down at the Stars' 26-yard-line, McGough threw a pass to Williams in the end zone which drew a pass interference penalty, placing the ball on the 11-yard-line; the Stallions scored two plays later on a pass from McGough to Bolden. Aubrey missed the extra point wide left, leaving Birmingham's lead at three points. It increased shortly thereafter, though, as Scooby Wright intercepted new Philadelphia quarterback K. J. Costello and return the pass for a touchdown. The Stallions led by ten points following the extra point. Philadelphia got the ball back with just under three minutes to play, at their own 42-yard-line. They reached the Birmingham 22-yard-line before the two-minute warning and scored a touchdown with 1:43 to play, narrowing the lead to three points. In lieu of a traditional onside kick, the Stars opted to try a 4th & 12 from their own 33-yard-line, which would allow them to keep possession of the ball should they convert it. The play was unsuccessful, though, and the Stallions took over. Scarbrough rushed on three plays in a row, gaining a net total of one yard, and Colby Wadman punted, which resulted in a touchback. After a pass for a gain of seven yards, Costello's pass was intercepted by Birmingham's Christian McFarland at the Stars' 43-yard-line, sealing the victory and the championship for Birmingham. They lined up in victory formation and closed out the game, winning 33–30.\n\nParagraph 10: At his wedding, Godefroy de Montmirail is interrupted by the news that his bride's father, Duke Fulbert, is gravely ill. Consulting the wizard Eusebius, Godefory finds out that the corridors of time are somehow being held open and this is killing his future father-in-law. Godefroy is determined to find how this has happened and who is responsible. Back in present day, Jaquouille and Ginete rob a supermarket, and drive to Beatrice for work. Jean-Pierre, the dentist who is married to Beatrice, has many patients who Jacquouille scares away, so Beatrice decides to let him watch TV. He believes it is a work of Satan, and destroys it and sets the house on fire. In the meantime, Jacquart is being tortured by the Inquisition by water cure. The inquisition shoves a funnel in his mouth and turns on a water pipe. Jacquart's belly begins rapidly growing to the point where his belly button pops out. He admits that Godefroy burnt his Range Rover (a reference to the first film), but the Inquisition believes that it was a person, Range Robert, and they are about to torture Jacquart further when Godefroy intervenes. In the future, Beatrice gives Jacquouille and Ginette the potion, and Jean-Pierre accidentally drinks one glass. She says the spell, and Jean-Pierre and Jacquouille fall in to the year 1123. Montmirail is being invaded, and he and Jacquouille fight the invaders. Godefroy is riding by, and he saves Jacquouille, but he sees that Jacquouille is wearing a huge ruby ring. Realising that Jacquouille stole the Duke's treasure and that the remaining items are in the future keeping the corridors of time open, they return, along with Jean-Pierre, and Jacquart. Jean-Pierre ends up in the forest, the others under the castle. They escape and terrorize the hotel, except for Jacquart who is urinating everywhere due to the water torture he underwent. Jaquouille and Godefory go to Ginette, who tried to turn in the rubies for money, and instead was beaten up. Cousin Hubert's ex-wife, Cora has the jewels, she tells them. They go to Cora's house, and take the jewels. In the morning, they go to Montmirail where a wedding is taking place. They create havoc at the wedding, by  pouring ice cream into a woman's cleavage, and using a plunger to destroy the police chief's hat. They take the potion, and say the spell, however, the potion has again been made wrongly, and they end up in 18th century France, during the French Revolution. Jacquouille sees his descendant, Jacqouillet, as an adviser to Napoleon Bonaparte, and screams to him as they are arrested as aristocrats."}

His mother was Mary Gibbs, his father, John, was first a fisherman and later a hotel keeper on the Toronto Islands. The Hanlan family originally lived at the east end of Toronto Island, but a severe storm in 1865 pushed their house into the harbour. It washed ashore near the north end of Gibraltar Point, at the island's west end. A few years later, Hanlan's father built a small hotel there, and the area started becoming known as Hanlan's Point, long before Hanlan became famous. Young Hanlan used to row several kilometres across the harbour to go to and from George Street public school, Toronto every day. He developed speed and strength by rowing his boat with freshly-caught fish to sell at market before other fishermen arrived to compete. By the time Hanlan was a teenager, he was competing in rowing events and he gained his first important success at the age of eighteen, when he became amateur champion of Toronto Bay.\n\nParagraph 5: A Jew of Frankfurt is mentioned in connection with the sale of a house at Cologne between 1175 and 1191. Eliezer ben Nathan, rabbi at Mainz toward the end of the twelfth century, says that there were not then ten adult Jews in Frankfurt. The first reliable information concerning Frankfurt Jews dates from 1241, on May 24 of which year 180 Hebrews were killed during a riot and many fled, this being the first Judenschlacht or slaughter of the Jews. As the affair was detrimental to the income of the emperor, he was incensed with the city for seven years. King Conrad IV did not forgive the citizens until May 6, 1246. The emperor distributed the income he derived from the Jews so liberally among the princes and his retainers  that he had little left for himself; yet the Jews remained under his protection. In 1286 King Rudolf pledged to Count Adolf of Nassau 20 marks yearly from the income derived from the Frankfurt Jews. When Adolf was made king under the title of \"Adolf of Nassau\", he pledged these 20 marks to the knight Gottfried of Merenberg (1292); and the latter again pledged 4 marks of this sum to the knight Heinrich of Sachsenhausen. King Adolf also gave 25 marks to Glottfried of Eppstein as a hereditary fief; and from 1297 he gave 300 marks yearly of the Jews' tax to the Archbishop of Mainz, adding to this sum 500 pounds of hellers in 1299. As early as 1303 the archbishop pledged 100 marks of this amount, and thus the Jews of the city of Frankfurt became subject to the archbishop. The emperor, however, attempted to exact still more money from the Jews, and it was  only thanks to the resistance of the city that King Adolf did not succeed in 1292 in extracting from them the sum required for his coronation.\n\nParagraph 6: In 401 BC Artaxerxes gave him his daughter Rhodogoune in marriage. In two inscriptions of king Antiochus I of Commagene on his monument at Nemrut, an Orontes, called Aroandes (son of Artasouras and husband of Artaxerxes's daughter Rhodogoune), is reckoned, among others, as an ancestor of the Orontids ruling over Commagene, who traced back their family to Darius I. Diodorus Siculus mentions another Orontes, possibly the same, that in 362 BC was satrap of Mysia and was the leader of the Satrap Revolt in Asia Minor, for which position he was well-suited because of his noble birth and his hatred of the king. Misled by his love of power and fraud, he betrayed his fellow satraps to the king. But he revolted a second time, probably owing to his dissatisfaction with the king's rewards, and launched several attacks, which were continued in the reign of the new king Artaxerxes III Ochus. During that time he also conquered and occupied the town of Pergamum, but finally he must have become reconciled with the king. In 349 he was honored by a decree of the Athenians with civic rights and a golden wreath. Many coins were struck by him during the Satraps' Revolt in Clazomenae, Phocaea, and Lampsacus. All subsequent Orontids are his descendants. Darius III was the satrap of Armenia following Orontes, from 344 to 336 BC. An Armenian contingent was present at the Battle of Gaugamela under the command of Orontes and a certain Mithraustes. Diodorus mentions that Orontes was a friend of the Macedonian general Peucestas. Armenia formally passed to the Macedonian Empire, as its rulers submitted to Alexander the Great. Alexander appointed an Orontid named Mithranes to govern Armenia following the defeat of Orontes II. With the agreement at Babylon after Alexander's death (323 BC) Armenia was assigned to Neoptolemus, and kept it till his death in battle in 321 BC. Around 302 BC the capital was transferred from Armavir to Yervandashat by Orontes.\n\nParagraph 7: The forming process is most often used to shrink or expand cylindrical tubing, but it can also form sheet metal by repelling the work piece onto a shaped die at a high velocity. High-quality joints can be formed, either by electromagnetic pulse crimping with a mechanical interlock or by electromagnetic pulse welding with a true metallurgical weld. Since the forming operation involves high acceleration and deceleration, mass of the work piece plays a critical role during the forming process. The process works best with good electrical conductors such as copper or aluminum, but it can be adapted to work with poorer conductors such as steel.\n\nParagraph 8: At the start, race starter Pat Vidan erroneously threw the green flag a lap early, triggering an 11-car accident which unfolded on the main stretch approximately 200 yards past the start/finish line, which halted the race immediately. As the green flag fell, Steve Krisiloff's car developed ignition problems and slowed on the front straightaway, falling back to parallel with the fifth row by the time he crossed the start/finish line. This caused the rest of the field behind Krisiloff to shuffle towards the outside to avoid the slowing car. Seconds later in the sixth row, just past the start/finish line, Salt Walther tangled wheels with Jerry Grant, climbed over Grant's left-front wheel, overturned in the air and slammed into the catch fence. The car cut a  chunk out of the fence on impact, breaking two 4 inch steel stanchions before being thrown back onto the track by the reinforcing cables positioned behind the fence. The impact ripped open both of Walther's fuel tanks, sending 75 gallons of flaming methanol in a massive pale blue fireball (not apparent on TV or film footage) and dousing many spectators; with the blast of heat felt at least 100 yards away in the Paddock grandstand and Track Boxes, per eyewitness accounts. Eleven grandstand spectators were injured, and nine required hospitalization. As the front of Walther's car dug into the fence, the nose was also sheared off and Walther's legs were exposed. The car landed back on the racing surface upside-down, and spun wildly down the main stretch, spraying burning fuel in all directions. The spinning car was hit by at least two other cars, and a total of at least ten other cars became involved in the crash, including: Wally Dallenbach, Mike Hiss, Lee Kunzman, John Martin, David Hobbs, Mike Mosley, Jim McElreath and Dick Simon. Several cars were damaged extensively, and debris and burning fuel now littered the track. Kunzman later recalled that he thought he had been blinded by hitting the burning fuel until his car stopped and he flipped up his visor, as the intense heat had crinkled it so severely, he could not see where he was going.\n\nParagraph 9: The return of democracy coincided with the comeback of the previously cracked-down autonomist and separatist claims. A regional chamber to draft the Statute was created on 9 April 1945, but did not operate until as late as 26 April 1946, because of the slow pace of negotiations at each round of the talks. Lussu and the Sardinian Action Party championed in fact a solution that saw the island as a state associated with a federal country, rather than being assimilated like an ordinary Italian region within a unitary framework, but such demands were met with strong opposition from the Italian statewide parties: the Christian Democracy (DC), around which the majority of the island's notables were then gathered, supported in fact a generic regional framework with some devolution, geared towards accommodation for the central government in Rome; the Liberal Party (PLI) advocated for what little autonomy was needed to carry out only the administrative functions, without the capacity to create any regional laws; the Communist Party (PCI), which shut down the Communist Party of Sardinia two years earlier, was hostile to the idea of giving Sardinia any autonomy at all, the Italian Communists considering it a reactionary tool that stood in the way of a transformation towards a single Italian Communist society; the right-wing parties and the Common Man's Front were against the idea of Sardinian autonomy as well, because of Italian nationalism. In the end, the line prevailing was the one supported by the DC that, claiming to be willing to avoid \"serious institutional conflicts\", ditched the federal hypothesis in favour of a binary system of governance agreed upon the region and the central state. As much as some important authors in the field of Sardinian studies regard the granted Statute as Italy's definite acknowledgment of a distinct historical, geographic, social, ethnic and linguistic status,\"Una Sardegna di cittadini e non di sudditi\" (from \"Storia dell’Autonomia sarda 1847–2018\", edited by Manlio Brigaglia and Salvatore Mura, Delfino. the \"Sardinian specialty\" as a criterion for political autonomy ended up being specified just on the grounds of a couple of socio-economic issues devoid of any of the aforementioned considerations.Pintore, Gianfranco (1996). La sovrana e la cameriera: La Sardegna tra sovranità e dipendenza. Nuoro: Insula, 13 As time was pressing, the Sardinian regional Statute was eventually written by the Constituent Assembly in Rome, followed by a rapid review of each section and without further debate. Some unique articles appeared in the final version, mentioning state-funded plans (going by the Italian piani di rinascita \"rebirth plans\") for the heavy industrial development of the island.\n\nParagraph 10: The 1994 national census reported a total population for this woreda of 90,186, of whom 45,657 were men and 44,529 were women; 4,597 or 5.1% of its population were urban dwellers. The ethnic make up of the region is widely disputed. Documentation shows that following the annexation of the area into the Tigray region, a mass effort was undertaken to re-populate the area with a majority Tigray ethnic migrants while displacing the local Amhara population. Various steps were taken to dramatically change the demographic make up of the region including, a change to the official language for regional administration and teaching in public schools to Tigrigna and repossession of land from the majority Amhara farming population. Notably, records going back into the 1980’s show that the region was populated predominantly by ethnic Amhara. As a result of these mass efforts, the ethnic demographic of the region was dramatically altered. The 2007 census data indicates that the ethnic groups reported in Welkait are now Tigray (96.58%), Amhara (3.03%); and all other ethnic groups made up only 0.39% of the population. Tigrinya is spoken as a major language by 97.14%, and 2.75% speak Amharic; the remaining 0.11% spoke all other primary languages reported. 96.75% of the population said they were Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, and 3.09% were Muslim. Concerning education, 3.9% of the population were considered literate, which is less than the Zone average of 9.01%; 3.36% of children aged 7–12 were in primary school, which is less than the Zone average of 11.34%; a negligible number of the children aged 13–14 were in junior secondary school, which is also less than the Zone average of 0.65%; and a negligible number of children aged 15–18 were in senior secondary school, which is less than the Zone average of 0.51%. Concerning sanitary conditions, about 1% of the urban houses and about 8% of all houses had access to safe drinking water at the time of the census; about 4% of the urban and about 4% of all houses had toilet facilities."}

In the 9th century, Reichenau was affiliated with more than a hundred other monasteries and chapters in Germany, Switzerland, France and Italy. This affiliation was chiefly due to the reform of the monastery by St. Benedict of Aniane, and is the largest brotherhood known to us. Alcuin worked in the west of the Frankish Empire, and before him St. Boniface had sought with eager zeal to establish and foster in Germany such unions and brotherhoods with England and Italy. Similarly an \"Act of Spiritual Association\" between the Abbeys of St. Denis of France and St. Remy of Reims arranged that, within thirty days after the death of a member, the entire Office be recited by each of the surviving members, that the priests say Masses corresponding to the various offices, and that vigils be held in common on the first, seventh, and thirteenth days. At mediaeval synods, the bishops and abbots present frequently formed themselves into such brotherhoods, often extending to the cathedral chapters and monasteries, and to the kings and princes who were present at the councils – in the 8th and 9th centuries, a series of such synods took place: Attigny (762); Dingolfing (769); Frankfort (794); Salzburg (799); Freising (805); Clechyt 815; Savionières near Toul (850). Brotherhoods were also formed at other English and Italian synods. At diocesan synods all the clergy of a diocese with their bishop formed themselves into brotherhoods, and frequently priests of still smaller districts (rural chapters) formed lesser associations of prayer to which the laity were also admitted. Individuals of every station, rank, and sex eagerly joined these associations, while numerous rich persons funded monasteries to insure a special share in their suffrage after death. English kings, bishops, abbots and Carolingian kings gave them an excellent example, as did St. Boniface and Alcuin. Even the laity of the lower classes joined the brotherhoods of St. Gall and Reichenau. The communion of spiritual goods and indulgences, granted by monasteries in the last centuries to another monastery, to benefactors and friends outside the cloister, or to other confraternities, is more than a memorial of the old brotherhoods, since in these grants (communicationes) the promise of spiritual help for the deceased is one of the chief features.\n\nParagraph 3: Unlike closed-box loudspeakers, which are nearly airtight, a bass reflex system has an opening called a port or vent cut into the cabinet, generally consisting of a pipe or duct (typically circular or rectangular cross section). The air mass in this opening resonates with the \"springiness\" of the air inside the enclosure in exactly the same fashion as the air in a bottle resonates when a current of air is directed across the opening. Another metaphor often used is to think of the air like a spring or rubber band. The frequency at which the box/port system resonates, known as the Helmholtz resonance, depends upon the effective length and cross sectional area of the duct, the internal volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the early years of ported speakers, speaker designers had to do extensive experimentation to determine the ideal diameter of the port and length of the port tube or pipe; however, more recently, there are numerous tables and computer programs that calculate, for a given size of cabinet, how large the port should be and how long the tube should be. Even with these programs, however, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to determine if the enclosure sounds good.\n\nParagraph 4: The International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum is a program offering at Springbrook.

No fewer than six manuscripts have been found dedicated to stories about him. The oldest two are El Escorial (or E, 1867 lines) and Grottaferrata versions (or G, 3749 lines), from the names of the libraries in which the respective manuscripts are held. While the form (or forms) in which it has survived is not the product of oral composition, it has nevertheless retained a considerable number of features of its oral origins. The common core of the two versions preserved in the E and G manuscripts goes back to the twelfth century. The text of E appears to be closer to the original composition while G represents a version that is heavily marked by learned reworking. Both texts give enchanting descriptions of the life of the martial societies of the border regions of the empire, while in the figure of Digenes are concentrated the legends that had accumulated around local heroes. El Escorial version is the superior of the two in respect of the power and immediacy of the battle scenes and austerity of style. The epic descriptions of the mounted knights and battles are marked by drama, a swift pace and lively visual detail.\n\nParagraph 7: Amrinder signed for Mumbai City on a permanent deal from Bengaluru in 2017.

He agreed to direct We Love Katamari when Namco executives stated they would continue development with or without his input. The game was given a larger budget and staff compared to the original, with Takahashi leading a team of 30 employees to create it. We Love Katamari is themed around fanservice as a response to the significant support from fans for Katamari Damacy. Takahashi mandated that it needed to retain the spirit of its predecessor while also feeling new and fresh at the same time.\n\nParagraph 9: The sura starts with three oaths; when the Quran presents an oath, there is a response (jawab) which is related to the oath. That is the central message of the surah. So without understanding the oath and its response, the message of the surah cannot be fully understood. In Classical Arabic, a location would be called by what it was famous for. So fig and olive can refer to two locations. Fig refers to Mount Judi, where Prophet Nuh's Ark landed, while At-Teen referring to Prophet Noah, the location where his Ark ship landed, az-Zaytoon referring to Jesus who was born in Palestine where olives grow or Al-Aqsa Mosque in Palestine. These oaths refer to the 2 fruits and also their locations. So the idea that fig and olive refers to both fruit and location was a view of the Sahabah and their early students. According to Ruh al-Ma'ani by Mahmud al-Alusi The intent in naming two fruits is to mention two mountains from the Holy land of Palestine. Toor refers to a lush, full of trees, green mountain. After Sayna in Sura Al-Mu'minoon, Seeneen is the second version of the name of Mount Sinai which existed in the Hebrew Language among the Scholars. This mountain was not known among the Arabs generally. It is generally believed that Muhammad was illiterate and he did not have any Jewish companions in the Makkan era when this surah was revealed. So without knowing the narrations of Moses or Hebrew language, Muhammad was describing the variations in language of Hebrew linguist scholars. This was a proof of the Quran being divine word of GOD for the people who had most classified and secret narratives of Moses. \"This entrusted city\", primarily referring to Mekah, also refers to Muhammad just as Noah, Moses and Jesus were referred by means of mentioning their relative locations in first two ayaat. A contemporary scholar Nouman Ali Khan suggests that it also refers to Abraham as he was the person who established the city Mekah.\n\nParagraph 10: Dakota departed for her seventh trans-Pacific voyage from Seattle on February 17, 1907. The ship was under command of captain Emil Francke, a former German navy officer and a former captain of the American Line steamer St. Louis and had a crew consisting of 59 whites and 220 Chinese. The ship was carrying 94 passengers and 6,720 tons of general cargo consisting largely of cotton, wheat and flour and valued at $445,984.00. The steamer passed Inuboye around noon on March 3, and arrived in view of Nojimazaki Lighthouse in the afternoon, with weather being clear and the seas calm. As the ship got delayed somewhat on her departure, captain Francke wanted to make up time and arrive at Yokohama before the darkness would set in and avoid all the fishing boats that would flood the Tokyo Bay and would force the ship to slow down considerably. At approximately 16:00 captain Francke relieved the first officer and assumed control of the bridge. The ship was travelling at about  at the time and was sailing very close to the coastline contrary to an accepted practice as the area is known to be full of underwater rocks and reefs. At 17:04, as the passengers on board were enjoying their tea on deck, the steamer ran aground at full speed over a reef about a mile off Shirahama. Due to speed of the vessel, she went about 3/4 of her length over the reef before coming to a stop, damaging her bottom in the process. The ship quickly filled with water, sinking her bow up to the second mast, and extinguishing the engines, with only her stern part being above the water. Panic spread among the passengers, but the order was quickly restored by the crew, and the lifeboats were lowered. Being only about a mile away from the shore, a large number of sampans sprang to her aid, as well as the boats from a nearby steamer Tokai Maru which witnessed the whole incident. All passengers and crew safely reached the land, and were housed in the lighthouse and nearby hamlets as the area was very sparsely populated. Steamer Omi Maru was dispatched from Yokohama to collect the passengers, but she had to return empty-handed as it was impossible to get close to the wreck. During the night of March 3 the wreck of Dakota was looted by the locals and in response the Japanese government dispatched cruiser Yaeyama and a torpedo boat to stand by to prevent any further incidents but only stayed for a short while due to inability to close in to the wreck."}

Piquet used the new suspension in a race simulation and achieved faster lap times than Mansell had previously. Piquet then used the new suspension in the Italian Grand Prix, where it proved to be much faster than the passive suspension, allowing him to win the race.

As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with \"blank slates\", and come up with ways to \"reinvigorate and reinvent the show\". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be \"double identity\"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would \"react\" to the situation; \"he's going to seek out trouble.\" Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a \"secret identity\". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the \"No flights, no tights\" rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.\n\nParagraph 2: It was not until later in the summer of 1915 that Townshend returned to his command. He reported that if he could defeat the Ottomans at Kurna, he could take Baghdad at once, which led Nixon to reply that he was looking forward to riding into Baghdad in triumph on a white horse. On 23 August 1915, Townshend reported to London that if he defeated the Ottomans \"and stampeded them, as at Kurna, he was willing to take the responsibility of entering Baghdad\". He noted that it was about 500 miles from where he was to Baghdad and that he was \"undermanned as regards land and water transport\", lacking enough ships and wagons to supply a drive to Baghdad, but reflecting the optimistic mood, wrote \"Sir John Nixon told me to send him a wire if I intended a rush into Baghdad, as he might be able to come on in time to enter Baghdad with me.\" As long as the outcome of the Battle of Gallipoli was in doubt, the Ottomans exerted all of their efforts there and largely ignored Townshend's \"Regatta up the Tigris\". However, by August 1915 it was clear that Gallipoli was a stalemate following the failure of the British to break out after their landings at Suvla Bay, which ended the last British chance of victory there. The deadlock was strategically an Ottoman victory, as it prevented the Allies from taking Constantinople. With the Allies contained at Gallipoli, the Three Pashas who now ruled the Ottoman Empire sent a substantial force of Turkish infantrymen under General Nureddin Pasha to stop Townshend. Before the arrival of Nureddin, Townshend had been facing Ottoman Arab units which were of lesser quality as compared to the ethnic Turkish Ottoman units. The core of the Ottoman Army had always been Turkish peasant conscripts from Anatolia, well known for their toughness and tenacity in combat. As he was soon to learn, the ethnic Turkish units in the Ottoman Army were far tougher opponents than the ethnic Arab ones.\n\nParagraph 3: Upon boarding the train, riders fasten their seat belts and lower their individual lap bar into place. Both red and blue trains are dispatched simultaneously and make a 200-degree turn opposite each other and proceed toward the lift hill. The trains meet up again behind the station where they turn back 20 degrees and begin their ascent side by side. At the top of the lift hill, the trains slowly make their way toward the edge before careening down the first drop, reaching speeds of over . Riders race over two small, yet powerful air time-filled hills before traveling upward and leveling out into a set of trim brakes at the far end of the out-and-back layout. Here, trains are slowed and riders enter a massive 560-degree helix where they circle downward over a small marsh, gradually picking up speed along the way.  The helix circles to the left, allowing the red train to pull away, being on the inside of the track. Riders fly out of the helix before the tracks finally separate. The blue train drops low to the earth in an attempt to gain back some of the ground it lost in the helix, while the red train rises up and passes over the blue. Both trains turn right 20 degrees until they are running parallel with each other but separated by the outbound tracks. The red train drops down after passing over the blue and flies over two more airtime hills while the blue train only leaps over one hill after turning its way through the wooden supports. Both trains then rise into the massive wooden structure of the lift hill and are slowed by a final set of trim brakes. Each train then dives opposite each other into a final 360-degree helix, often accompanied by much squealing from the wheels skidding on the metal rails as they negotiate the turn. The blue train circles at a significantly smaller radius in a final attempt at making up the ground it lost in the big helix. The two trains then emerge and rise into the brake run to determine the winner.\n\nParagraph 4: The dam began to fill in December 1974 after construction was commenced in 1969 by the Portuguese colonial government of Mozambique (Portugal), and is  high by  wide at the crest. Before the Cahora Bassa dam underwent construction, the native people protested the dam in order to keep their land. Built in the first half of the 1970s when Mozambique was still a Portuguese territory, long stretches of the power transmission lines were sabotaged during 16 years of Mozambican Civil War which ended in 1992. The lake has reached a maximum length and width of approximately  and  respectively, flooding an area of  with an average depth of .  Today, the Portuguese government owns eighty-two percent of the Cahora Bassa Lake and the Cahora Bassa dam while the Mozambique government owns the remaining 18 percent. When given the order to begin construction in 1969, the colonial government of Portugal forced the native people out of their homes and villages in order for the Portuguese and European workers to have a place to live during construction. The Cahora Bassa dam was built in order for more power to go to South Africa. The Portuguese government built a small town for all the contractors, electricians, and engineers on top of the native Mozambique homes. The evicted native people were not given compensation for their loss of property. The dam was built to produce electricity for South African farms, mines, and cities. Since the dam transfers the electricity that it creates to South Africa, it is taking electricity away from the natives that were able to keep some of their land. The natives now struggle for electricity and a regular supply of clean drinking water. Before 2010, the average annual rainfall was thirty-seven inches. This has been decreasing ever since and in 2016, the average annual rainfall was twenty-five inches.  If this average continues to fall, the dam operators may have to shut off the flow to some or even all the turbines. Doing so will conserve the water and energy until the reservoir is full enough to allow water to spin the turbines and create more electricity. Having some or all turbines will cause parts of South Africa to lose energy. During the plant shutdown, Songo and Apollo will have a fraction of the energy coming into the converter stations. These places will still be able to use electricity due to the energy that has been stored in a device called an accumulator or by using the pumping method. This method is done by pumping water into a reservoir and letting it go through a turbine when energy is needed..\n\nParagraph 5: WCAX radio had been a CBS Radio affiliate since 1940, so channel 3 became a CBS television affiliate and has been with the network ever since. As such, until 2017, WCAX-TV was one of the few stations in the United States (not counting network owned-and-operated stations) that has had the same owner, channel number, and primary network affiliation throughout its history. The station did hold a secondary Fox affiliation from 1994 through 1997, carrying that network's sports and children's programming; through this arrangement, WCAX-TV was able to carry Fox's NFL coverage, which consisted of the rights to NFC games that had been held by CBS (and thus aired on WCAX-TV) until 1994. Cable and satellite viewers received the rest of Fox's programming via the Foxnet cable service in northern Vermont, New York City-based superstation WNYW in most areas of the New York side of the market (except for the far southern reaches, which were served by Albany affiliate WXXA-TV), and Rochester affiliate WUHF and later Buffalo affiliate WUTV in southwestern Quebec. The secondary Fox affiliation ended when WFFF-TV (channel 44) signed on in 1997. On October 25, 2006, WCAX-TV upgraded its digital signal to broadcast CBS programming in high definition.\n\nParagraph 6: Angelica Santos is a really hard-working girl who had a really hard life. She works in a tobacco place and makes them and reads stories to her friends (co-workers) to encourage them. She is loved by everyone. She has a really mean aunt, who has a bar, and at night makes her work at the bar to serve beer for the people. The clients there are perverts and one night a man who tries to rape her. She escapes before he could do anything to her. She goes to the capital and meets a journalist who wants her to participate in the Queen of Caribbean contest, she accepts. Days later, she meets the love of her life Antonio Guzman a rich man whose father organized the contest and when they met he was helping carrying journals. He has a girlfriend. She thought he worked by carrying journals, but later finds out the truth and forgives him. They fall in love, Antonio breaks up with his girlfriend. Angelica wins Queen of Caribbean. After she won, her aunt blackmails her by telling her that she'll tell Antonio about her past and lie to him by telling him that she was a prostitute if she doesn't give her money. Angelica doesn't want to fall for it, so she makes a CD where she tells Antonio about her past. Everything gets erased on the CD while he was working on his computer and doesn't see it. He didn't care and told her that he doesn't care about anything on the CD which made Angelica so happy. On the day of their wedding, Angelica's aunt, Antonio's brother and the man who tried to rape her come and sabotaged the wedding, told Antonio about her past and lie by saying that she's a prostitute. Antonio doesn't believe Angelica and they break up. She is no longer queen and goes somewhere else and open a restaurant. She takes revenge on the man who tried to rape her and he goes to prison. Days after she goes back to the capital, Antonio is back with his ex-girlfriend. One day, he asks someone to fix the CD and he sees what was on it. He and Angelica become friends. he breaks up with his girlfriends. Angelica participates in the competition and win Queen of Caribbean. That night they get back together. Antonio and Agelica get married and in the end, she goes to her village with Antonio and tell them their story.\n\nParagraph 7: Stanisic, born in Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia, began playing soccer with Partizan. Although he made no appearance in the Yugoslav First League, he played a total of 56 games for Partizan, two of which were in the Yugoslav Cup.  In 1984, Stanisic moved to the United States where he signed with the New York Cosmos. While the Cosmos had gained its reputation as a top outdoor team in the North American Soccer League, that league had folded and the Cosmos had moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Stanisic and the Cosmos began the 1984-1985 MISL season, but the team’s finances led to its leaving the league before the end of the season and folding a few weeks later. Stanisic then moved to the Chicago Sting, another ex-NASL team now playing in MISL. He spent two seasons in Chicago before moving to the Baltimore Blast in 1988. In 1988, Stanisic moved to the Hershey Impact of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA).  On November 8, 1990, the Blast released Stanisic.  The San Diego Sockers expressed an interest in signing Stanisic, but he chose to return to the Hershey Impact.  He then moved to the Illinois Thunder of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) for the 1991-1992 season.  He then moved to the Kansas City Attack (NPSL) for two seasons. However, Stanisic was plagued by injuries during the 1993-1994 season and was traded to the Harrisburg Heat during the 1994 off-season. In April 1995, he joined the Albany Alleycats for the summer outdoor season.  Stanisic experienced a rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star for the 1995-1996 season.   Stanisic only played four games for the Heat during the 1997-1998 season when the Attack purchased his contract on December 1, 1997 with cash and a pick in the upcoming Amateur Draft.   He played out the rest of the 1997-1998 season in Kansas City, seeing time in twenty-eight games. In the 1998-1999 season, he played in only ten games and is not listed on any team’s roster for the 1999-2000 season.   In 2000, Stanisic joined the Detroit Rockers where he played only eight games before retiring at the end of the 2000-2001 season.  On March 31, 2005, the Chicago Storm of the Major Indoor Soccer League signed Stanisic to a fifteen-day contract after injuries had decimated the Storm’s goalkeeper corps.  However, he played no games during those fifteen days before retiring permanently.  Stanisic finished his NPSL career sixth on the all time goalkeeper wins list with 127.  While Stanisic made his reputation in indoor soccer, he also played several seasons of outdoor soccer in the U.S.  In 1989, he signed with the Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1990, he was with the Washington Diplomats of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL).  The APSL was formed by the merger of the ASL and the Western Soccer League in 1989.  He was back with the Capitals in 1991, then spent the 1992 APSL season with the Miami Freedom.  In 1994, Stanisic returned to outdoor soccer with the Baltimore Bays of the USISL.\n\nParagraph 8: The team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, specifically through Piquet and chief designer Frank Dernie, after Mansell declared no confidence in the system having experienced a different version of it on the Lotus 92 in  which led him to being disillusioned with the system. After much testing Piquet found the car to be superior to the conventionally suspended FW11B. The new suspension was an active suspension system similar to the one Lotus had been using all season on the Lotus 99T, but was renamed as Williams Reactive Ride due to the Lotus team having copyright on the 'Active Suspension' name for the system. The Williams engineered suspension was also lighter, less complicated and drew much less power from the Honda engine than did the Lotus example. The first time a hydraulic variant of the system was tested Dernie fitted it to a 1984 FW09, and during testing Piquet noted that although the car rode very smoothly, it handled very badly. So Dernie redesigned the system and hired Paddy Lowe and Steve Wise to design an electronic computerized system. In a race simulation test at the Imola circuit, driving a reactive suspension FW11B, Piquet completed 59 laps some 3 minutes faster than Mansell had done to win the Grand Prix at the circuit earlier in the year, though it was noted that he was also the only car on the circuit for the simulation and thus wasn't slowed by having to lap other cars. Still, his confidence in the new suspension was absolute and he first used it in competition at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where it proved much faster than the passive suspension FW11B, allowing him to run with less wing and record the highest speed of the 1987 season when he was speed trapped at 218.807 mph (352.135 km/h), some 5 mph faster than Mansell could manage in the conventional suspension car. Piquet would start from the pole and win the race from the Lotus of Ayrton Senna, with Mansell unable to keep pace finishing 3rd. It took until the next race in Portugal before Mansell would try the reactive car during a Grand Prix weekend, although he only raced it during the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez. There were also plans in 1987 to introduce a semi automatic transmission, but this never came to pass.\n\nParagraph 9: Shark put to sea from New York on 26 February and joined Commodore James Biddle's squadron for the suppression of piracy and slave trading in the West Indies. On 25 March, Lt. Perry took formal possession of what is now Key West, Florida, in the name of the United States. He called the island Thompson's Island to honor Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson and named the harbor Port Rodgers to compliment Commodore John Rodgers. Under orders from Commodore Biddle, Shark departed Nassau on 14 August for another cruise to the coast of Africa and returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 12 December 1822. She again sailed for the West Indies in February 1823, and returned to New York on 9 July for repairs. On 5 October, she sailed from New York carrying Commodore John Rodgers and three Navy surgeons to Thompson's Island to determine the fitness of that place as a naval base. She debarked Rodgers and his party at Norfolk on 16 November 1823 before resuming her cruise in the West Indies. She returned to New York on 13 May 1824.\n\nParagraph 10: From the Early Middle Ages, Schneppenbach belonged to a major landhold of Saint Maximin's Imperial Abbey at Trier. The 2,742-hectare landhold comprised, besides the centres of Blickersau and Kaffeld, which later vanished, the villages of Woppenroth, Bundenbach, Schneppenbach, Bruschied and the main centre and parish seat of Hausen bei Rhaunen. Until the 18th century, Schneppenbach was administratively tightly bound with the Schmidtburg (castle), which nowadays stands within the village's municipal limits. The castle, whose beginnings go back at least as far as 929, and possibly as far as 926, is one of the oldest in the Nahe-Hunsrück region and is believed to have been the family seat of the Counts in the Nahegau, the Emichones. Their coheirs and rightful successors, the Waldgraves, owned the castle in the 12th and 13th centuries. Internal Waldgravial family disputes, however, resulted in ownership being transferred about 1330 to Archbishop and Elector of Trier Baldwin of Luxembourg. Under Baldwin, the castle was expanded, and in the time that followed, it became the seat of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Schmidtburg. While Bundenbach was the only village in the Amt that stood wholly under Electoral-Trier sovereignty, Bruschied and Schneppenbach formed a condominium and belonged jointly to the Electorate of Trier and the Knights of Wildberg. When the Amt of Schmidtburg was pledged to the Electoral-Trier Amtmann Nikolaus von Schmidtburg sometime before 1554, he temporarily introduced Calvinism. By 1626, though, the villages had reverted to Catholicism. In 1563, there were nine households in Schneppenbach, five in 1684 and eleven in 1715 that belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Schmidtburg. About 1650, records show that the local lord was the knight Sir Cratz von Scharffenstein. Schneppenbach formed together with Bruschied an Ingericht (local court district). The two villages' inhabitants only owned one chapel, and attended the main services in Bundenbach. In 1794, during the War of the First Coalition, the German lands on the Rhine's left bank were occupied by the French, and in 1798, the region was reorganized on the French administrative model by the French Directory. With this French administrative reform, the Amt of Schmidtburg was dissolved. Schneppenbach passed to the then newly founded Mairie (\"Mayoralty\") of Kirn in the Arrondissement of Simmern and the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle, remaining there for the rest of French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times. Then, in 1817, it passed to the Bürgermeisterei (\"Mayoralty\") of Gemünden in the Prussian Simmern district. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate after the Second World War, Schneppenbach was assigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land."}

The de Waterton family married into the de Methley family in the 14th century and moved into the hall. The hall had a magnificent great hall with a minstrels gallery, a grand staircase, and a beautifully decorated ceiling. Young Richard Plantagenet, also known as Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve. Robert Waterton, who was the custodian of Richard II and later a gaoler, was associated with the hall. The hall was demolished in 1964, but the Mexborough Estate still owns a significant amount of land in the area.

It was one of the first bands to introduce rock music to the Soviet show business. The Flowers were established in 1969 by guitar player and songwriter Stas Namin. In 1973 The Flowers released flexis with producing company Melodiya; overall seven million copies were sold. After becoming a major hit in the USSR, in 1974 the band went on its first professional tour; but in 1975 the band dissolved as a result of a conflict with the Philharmonic Society, and it was liquidated by a decree of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR, its name was banned. It was only in 1977 that the band was resurrected under the new name The Stas Namin Group, in 1978 it went on tour still being banned by all central mass media outlets. In 1980, during the years of the Olympic Thaw, the band managed to release a solo album with Melodiya – Hymn to the Sun – and participate in a TV show, after that they were banned once again. The period of bans and persecution that lasted to 1986 ended with Perestroika when the life of the band got much easier: with their returned name The Flowers went on tour, performed abroad in the Western countries and completed a world tour in four years. In 1990 the band ceased its activities and, as a matter of fact, did not exist for the next almost ten years.\n\nParagraph 2: Sixteen civilians were taken by coach to a military training facility in Florida, and were quickly subjected to the four drill instructors' aggressive induction processing. After receiving haircuts more suitable for the military, the recruits were taken to their Barracks where they would sleep and eat for the rest of the process. Within five hours of arrival, Katherine was already having doubts about being in Boot Camp and after feigning illness, decided to quit the game. Meyer immediately became seen as a troublemaker, finding it hard to take the process seriously, and was soon disliked by the most of the squad, but after encouragement from Thomson, prepared a damage limitation speech, apologizing and asking the others for a second chance over breakfast. Although many of the female recruits were convinced by the speech, the males were more skeptical. After a random selection process, Wolf was named as the first Squad Leader. On a 1.5-mile run, Haar's physical limitations became clear to the others, but despite a struggle she pushed through and completed the run. During the mission, the core group of strong males – Wolf, Moretti, Jackson and Park - upset Brown, who felt that they were treating the females as inferiors, and along with Meyer, she rallied the women to vote out Park in order to prevent themselves from being picked off by the stronger members of the squad. Park confronted Meyer, leading to the men agreeing to target him. At Dismissal Hill, the vote was close, but eventually Meyer and Brown's campaigning paid off, and Park became the first to be dismissed in a vote of 7-6-1-1. Due to Katherine leaving the game, Park was not given the chance to discharge any of the remaining members of the squad.\n\nParagraph 3: With the 2012 recast, Kristina returns home with a \"vengeance\" after discovering the truth about her parents' bribing the admissions office at Yale University to get her accepted. Morgan admits that Kristina's actions may be a bit questionable at times, but she only does certain things to get those around her to be honest with her. \"Even though she is basically, really, extorting them right now, she's doing it almost for an ethical reason. In the end it's to expose her father--and her mother--and say, 'Hello, this is wrong!'\" The plot in which Kristina forces her family to star in her reality show is also her way of asserting her independence. \"College has shown her her own strength, her own power. And she's very much her father's daughter--and very much her mother's daughter. And very much tired of it all. Tired of them going behind her back, and tired of them being controlling. She needs to have her own say in her life.\" However, most viewers and critics didn't approve of the new direction and the reality aspect of the storyline. ABC Soaps in Depth gave the storyline a \"Thumbs Down!\" comparing it to a bad spoof of VH1's hit reality series, Mob Wives and the recast which is initially met with much disapproval is weighed down by the story. While SID has no problem with such a drastic character change as Ainsworth's Kristina according to SID is \"relatable and likably soft\" and Morgan's Kristina is written as \"a jaded hell-raiser;\" the reality show is not the best way to get fans to approve of the recast. In an interview with TVSource Magazine's Omar Nobles, Morgan revealed that Kristina was mostly upset by Sonny and Alexis pulling strings to get her into Yale because of what their actions said about her; \"It's saying they didn't believe in her; she couldn't be admitted on her own and that hurt her. The people that she needs the most to believe in her doubted she could and that's why they did it... I also feel like they also thought she couldn't handle disappointment. That's what hurts her.\" Kristina forgives her parents knowing they meant well but she really cares about what they think of her. \"As the middle child, especially with them never being together and Sonny and his huge family and other children; Alexis is busy with everything in her life. I think Kristina feels like she never got enough attention and was never truly seen by them. So when she's becoming an adult she wants to say them 'I am an adult and I can do this' and they don't think so and that hurts her.\"\n\nParagraph 4: During the Communist era, Mizil depended for employment on three large factories employing almost the entire workforce. The largest, established in 1951, produced armaments; the next turned out spun textiles and the smallest made mattresses. The town reached an economic nadir in 1998-1999, when these laid off thousands of workers. One factory, formerly employing 8,500, fired all but around 400, while another dismissed almost all its 2,000 employees. Unemployment rose to 17.5% (against a national average of 8.7%); including those who had stopped looking for work, unemployment reached 80% of the working-age population (18 to 62). Poverty had reached alarming levels, with tension and crime also rising, particularly among the generally jobless, under-educated Roma. As of 2005, 39% of Mizil firms are involved in commerce, 15% in services, 12% in industry, 11% in construction, 5% in agriculture, 3% in transport, and 15% in other domains. That year, the working-age population was 65% of the total, of whom 30% had jobs. Roma represented a significant portion of the 70% who did not. Due to the factory closings, there was a dramatic fall in employment between 1994 and 2001; even with a slight rise in subsequent years, the workforce only reached half the 1994 level.\n\nParagraph 5: Methley Hall was the former seat of the Earl of Mexborough.  During the fourteenth century the de Waterton family married into the de Methley family and moved to Methley Hall, a large, imposing and solid castellated building, mostly spread over three storeys rising to four by the turreted entrance. An eighteenth century watercolour shows a great hall with a minstrels gallery and grand staircase, decorated and embossed ceiling with a full-length oriel window. Young Richard Plantagenet, Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve, with Waterton's family until 1423 when national events changed things. Robert Waterton was the custodian of Richard II whilst constable of Pontefract Castle from 1399 and later gaoler of James I of Scotland.  He was esquire to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV.  The seat at Methley Hall was conferred in 1410 to Robert's brother John Waterton. The Hall, which featured in a 1907 edition of Country Life, was demolished in 1964, although the Mexborough Estate are still significant landowners in the district. Queen Mary (Mary of Teck), consort of H. M. King George V, visited the village in 1935 and stayed at the Hall as a guest of the Earl. Titus Salt leased Methley Hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865 according to Salt's biographer Balgarnie.\n\nParagraph 6: The ruler of Hell is revealed not to be Happy, but a shapeshifting demon named Bill assuming her form. After failing to torment Gertrude with a twisted version of her home, he condemns her to an eternity of repeating her quest. Meanwhile, Horribella calls Bill and demands Queen Cloudia's bones, her payment for engineering Gertrude's death. Bill has the bones delivered to her by Duncan, who has become a postal courier. Horribella, planning to bring about the end of Fairyland, resurrects Cloudia as a powerful undead being who kills her and goes on a destructive rampage. Realising that Gertrude is the only one who can defeat \"Dark Cloudia\", Duncan and Larry confront the Fairyland Council and tell them that they must resurrect Gertrude to save Fairyland. The Council initially refuse, citing the rules of Fairyland, but Duncan retorts that the rules, and the council, are directly responsible for the crisis, and that by kidnapping children like him and Gertrude, they have abdicated any moral authority. One of the Council member concedes that Duncan is correct, and orders Bill to deliver the pocket dimension containing Gertrude's Hell to the council chamber. Duncan and Larry enter Hell and inform Gertrude about Dark Cloudia; subsequently, Gertrude agrees to kill Cloudia again. When returned to Fairyland she attempts to renege on the deal and demands to return to Hell when she realizes that her actions would serve the council's purpose. The Council nevertheless promises to return Gertrude home if she succeeds, and forcibly empowers her with their combined magic. Meanwhile, Dark Cloudia destroys the army of King Cone, the new Fairyland king, who tried to stop her wave of destruction in vain. Before the villain could slay the king, however, Gertrude appears and attacks her with her new magical powers, depowering Dark Cloudia and beating her up. Although Gertrude almost kills Cloudia again, Larry reminds her that the Council never specified that Cloudia has to die in their request, and Gertrude decides to follow his advice for once and gives the defeated villain to King Cone in order to be imprisoned for her crimes. The Council then appears, angry because Gertrude didn't kill Cloudia (despite the fact that she technically fulfilled their request) and threatening to exile her to a remote place in Fairyland, until Gertrude reminds them that she still has their combined magic inside her and would use it to kill them unless they honour their part of the deal, and the fearful Council quickly sends her back home, much to Larry's sorrow. Back on Earth, Gertrude, now an adult woman in her thirties, finds herself employed as a clerk in a television station, ironically frustrated by her mundane job and looking for a way to return. However, she abandons her search and ruefully curses Fairyland one last time before getting back to work, determined to face her lot in life.\n\nParagraph 7: In the past, the lake was at least  higher and larger than today, during the last glacial maximum it merged with neighbouring Laguna Blanca. Former highstands have left 30 major and 12 minor shorelines. The lake extended far east of its present-day shore. A maximum water level was reached 13,240 years before present. The two lakes today are only connected by a single channel and their properties are quite different. The lake is seldom ice-covered, water temperatures range between . Air temperatures range between , and UV radiation is 40% higher than at sea level. Environmental conditions have been compared to those on the planet Mars, and Laguna Verde has been cited as an example of how a lake on Mars would have evolved.\n\nParagraph 8: In the context of analyses of the soft power potential in Africa, Vogt accepted in February 2018 the invitation of the Personal Africa Representative of the Federal Chancellor and Africa Representative of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Günter Nooke, on a delegation journey \"On the Cultural and Religious Dimension of Sustainability\" to Ghana and Cameroon, and organized the return visit of twelve traditional authorities from sub-Saharan Africa (Cameroon, Benin, Gabon) to the Free State of Saxony in June 2018. In the run-up to a media public discussion between the Africa Representative and the Association of Professors in African Languages on 13 February 2019, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development asked Vogt for an assessment of the letter of 15 November 2018, addressed personally to the Federal Minister with numerous word mistakes and in which the Association had called for Nooke to be dismissed. Only the analysis, coordinated with two other colleagues, showed that the chairman of the association had copied an \"open letter\" from Cologne of 14.11.2018 (presumably a student's letter in view of the mistakes) by copy&paste and converted it into a personally addressed letter to the Federal Minister , using her official address at the University of Hamburg, without stating the copy&paste borrowing from students. This is problematic in the sense of the DFG guidelines on good scientific behaviour (quod licet bovi, non licet Iovi), but is at most an internal matter of the University of Hamburg, not of the Federal Government. The report therefore recommended not to inform the public about the assessment, only the Hamburg professor and her university. The BMZ's request of 08.02.2019 for an evaluation of the professors' association's letter was triggered by a press invitation of 07.02.2019 from the association which had not been coordinated with the BMZ. In this invitation, the chairman of the association had repeated the accusations of 15.11.2018, which was tantamount to a prejudgement of Nookes before the discussion and questioned the meaning of the discussion. In a concluding note Vogt summed up (following Thomas Bauer: Die Vereindeutigung der Welt, 2018): \"The 'causa' Nooke is exemplary for post-factual hypability, as it is called in New German. This means testing how - in a right-left shortening tunnel and detached from the factual situation - in our beautiful and perhaps precisely for this reason so often agitated country attention can be hedged. A fact-based MINT thinking like that of Günter Nooke, however, is not per se a right thinking, a humanities thinking open to polyvalences like that of the Africanists is not automatically a left thinking. And both are not incompatible either. In the theory of resilience, the Federal Republic finds itself in a highly dangerous, simplifying reduction and interlocking trap. The political extreme margins profit most from this trap\".\n\nParagraph 9: The Grey Goo starts small again in the late Cretaceous period, consuming the plants and animals of the area, before consuming a volcano and being hit by a meteor, which prevents the dinosaurs from going extinct. In the present, the scientist and the assistant experience changes in the timeline as they happen in the past. After being hit by the meteor, the grey goo travels through time again, but each time it travels through time it reverts to a small size. It then travels to Egypt, and consumes snakes, mummies, cats, people, buildings, and the pyramids. Next, it travels to Ancient Rome, where it consumes a feast, people, then buildings and destroys the city, forcing the Romans to pull together and prevent the fall of the empire. Next, it travels to Feudal Japan, where it eats rice, ninja, and buildings, but also consumes Monsterzilla, removing the world's protection from giant monsters and allowing them to ravage the present. The scientist by this point has figured out that the grey goo has only one jump left, this time to their future, and they must be prepared for it, so he and his assistant preserve their brains so they can survive until the grey goo appears. When it does, far in the future, it is microscopic instead of a few centimeters in diameter as when it usually jumps, but the scientist has prepared tiny robots to destroy the grey goo while it is still small. However, it evades the bots and grows larger, necessitating the scientist's second line of defense: energy weapons grafted onto ants, rats, and cats. It evades those too, growing large enough to consume the scientist and his assistants' brains. Giant humanoid tanks armed with powerful lasers are dispatched to destroy the goo, now several meters in diameter, but it evades the blasts, consumes future technology, people, and cars, and destroys the tanks too, destroying the city. Next, it launches into space, grows on small asteroids, destroys humanity's last line of defense - armed circular satellites that measure roughly 120 kilometers in diameter - then moves on to destroy Earth, the moon, and the planets (excluding Pluto as it is too small compared to the gas giants). Next, the grey goo consumes small stars around the sun, then the sun itself, working up to red giants. The goo eats the largest stars (red hypergiants); though one of them undergoes a hypernova leaving a black hole, the goo consumes the black hole as well. The goo continues to consume nebulae, star clusters, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Ripping through the fabric of time, it eats said fabric and discovers that the space-time continuum is resting on the back of a turtle, which is on the back of a slightly larger turtle, and that it's turtles all the way down. It then eats the turtles until they are gone, but since the turtles are infinite, the goo's feast is never-ending, then the game is over.\n\nParagraph 10: I know this man from Afghanistan when he visited me in my own home begging me for some help.  I did not have anything to offer [him].  But when I looked at his overall look and his dirty clothing he had on, he looked so miserable.  So I went to another friend of mine and asked him for money.  That person gave me about $3 and I gave it to ISN 758.  I have invited him to stay at my house for that particular night, but he refused.  This person came back to me again (meaning ISN 758) asking me for more money that I didn't have to give him.  I also learned from other people that this person was addicted to Hash, he smokes grass.  This was a reason that made me decide not to help him because every time I would help him he would spend it on Hash.  To me he was not a political person, a religious person, or a military person.  I have never heard once that he hated America or  allies.  I never heard that he really served with the Taliban.  He received some help from the Taliban like other Iraqi refugees, and I am one of them.  I am one of them and I have received help from the Taliban.  They only gave me food for my family and me.  They gave me a house to stay with my family.  In regards to 758, they did not give him a house because he was not married.  They only gave [one] to me.  He is a peaceful man and he does not pose a threat on nobody and he has parents that need him.  Anything that happened between him and me, like some kind of animosity was a result of the investigators here on this facility.  So they can create animosity between the two of use .  I was exposed to a lot of abuse, psychological abuse from the investigators and God only knows what happened.  This person ISN 758 is innocent from any allegations and God knows everything.  This is what I have and peace be upon [you]."}

During the first two practice sessions, the car presented itself with very slow pace, and was even further down the grid than during the winter testing. On Saturday there was no improvement, as both drivers qualified on the back of the grid, with Russell in front of Kubica but was three seconds behind the McLaren of Carlos Sainz. The race was a disaster for the team, as both drivers crossed the line adrift of the field with George Russell and Robert Kubica taking respectively the 16th and 17th spot, capitalizing only on three drivers who didn't finish the race. The team found no success during the first half of the season despite upgrades to the car.  It wasn't until Germany that they finally broke through with Kubica finishing 10th and scoring their first point of the season, capitalising on 7 drivers that failed to complete the full race distance and after both Alfa Romeo drivers (who finished 7th and 8th) received severe time penalties for driver aids at the start of the race. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Williams showed signs of progress after Russell narrowly missed out on Q2, and was able to carry this progress into the race. The following round saw Kubica failing to qualify because of an engine failure and having to start from the pit lane while Russell started 14th on the grid because of multiple drivers taking grid penalties despite qualifying 19th. A similar situation saw both cars start in the top 15 for the first time in Italy because of the same reason. Their classified finish streak took a tumble when George Russell retired from a collision on lap 34 at the Singapore Grand Prix. Due to Russell crashing into the barriers following brake issues, and Williams deciding to retire Kubica in order to conserve parts, the following round in Russia saw their first double retirement since the 2018 German Grand Prix. During qualifying at Suzuka, Kubica crashed his car after hitting the outside wall at the exit of turn 18, after running wide onto the grass destroying the car's front wing and left-hand wheels, causing significant damage to the survival cell, thus forcing the Williams mechanics to change the Pole's chassis and gearbox, forcing him to start in the pitlane.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1923, Di Fausto started to work for the governor of the Italian Islands of the Aegean, Mario Lago. This was a liberal and far-sighted diplomat, the first civilian governor of the islands after their occupation in 1912 during the Italo-Turkish War, who favored the peaceful coexistence among the different ethnic groups of the islands: Greeks, Turks, Ladinos and, since 1912, Italians. His first work in Rhodes was the city plan, finished on 29 January 1926: he chose to retain almost totally the medieval walled city, isolating the ancient walls and introducing respect zones, and reused paths and alignments of the ancient plan by Hippodamus of Miletus for the new quarters. The new city was erected outside the walls, south of the west bank of the Mandraki harbour, and was conceived as a garden city, an urban model which was highly fashionable in Italy in those years. The main road of the new town, south of the Mandraki, was christened Foro Italico, and there Di Fausto designed the main buildings, preferring an eclectic style mixing Byzantine, Ottoman, Roman Renaissance, Venetian, Knight Chivalric and local elements. This style was well suited for the multi-ethnic population of the island. The most important works among the many which he designed in Rhodes city are: the Palazzo del Governo (today the prefecture building) built in 1926, in Venetian Gothic style, with a white and pink stone façade, resembling the Doge's Palace in Venice; the neo-Renaissance post office building of 1927; the Catholic cathedral of Saint John of the Knights (now Evangelismos Greek orthodox church), rebuilt among great quarrels in 1924–25, whose plans were reconstructed using engravings of the original church, located within the walled city and destroyed in 1856; the Grande Albergo delle Rose, now Casino Rhodos, built with Michele Platania, but \"cleansed\" of all its deco embellishments in the late 1930s by Governor Cesare Maria de Vecchi; above all, the Mercato nuovo (Nea Agora, \"New Market\"), the center of the new city, an irregular polygonal structure enclosing the fishmongers pavilion, which possesses an unquestionable Oriental style. Besides Rhodes, Di Fausto was active also in Kos, where his most important works are the Palazzo del Governo (1927–29) and the Catholic church of the Agnus Dei (1927), built with Rodolfo Petracco, with central plan and a bell tower tapered on the façade, considered his best work in the Dodecanese; in Kastellorizo, where he erected the Delegate's Building; in Kalymnos and Leros. Since 1926 ever increasing differences of opinion with the governor pushed him to gradually abandon his commitments in the Aegean. The quarrel ended in 1927 with a legal dispute, where Di Fausto showed that during his service in the Dodecanese he had designed no less than fifty buildings—houses, public buildings, churches, barracks, markets, schools—thirty two of them already built or in construction in 1927. To keep this high pace of work, the architect worked also during his frequent boat trips between Italy and Rhodes.\n\nParagraph 3: The Directorate-General for External Policies (DG EXPO) deals with assisting the work of Parliament's delegations, committees and their chairmen as well as coordinating relations and cooperation with the other institutions, national parliaments and foreign bodies.

Lê Văn Hưng created a secret campaign \"Operation Linking Hands\" to send the remaining ARVN soldiers and officers to hidden jungle locations and military bases places in Mekong Delta to form a prolonged counteroffensive against the PAVN/VC hoping for another ceasefire in early summer 1975 and keeping parts of the Mekong Delta as South Vietnam. Weeks before the Fall of Saigon, most of the provincial capitals in IV Corps were stable defended by aggressive ARVN military defenses. However, VC units began to engage ARVN forces and succeeded in isolating IV Corps from Saigon which put an end to the \"secret section\" plan. When President Minh announced the surrender of South Vietnam, IV Corps started to disintegrate. Both Lê Văn Hưng and IV Corps commander Nguyễn Khoa Nam disagreed with the surrender order. At 8 pm, VC units captured some regional districts in Mekong Delta. Although Lê Văn Hưng and a number of ARVN soldiers planned to continue to battle against VC units in Can Tho, many residents of Can Tho opposed continued resistance believing the VC would start shelling Can Tho causing numerous casualties in the city. Lê Văn Hưng agreed to stand down the defense of Can Tho due to the poor options for escape or prolonged defense. Around 8 P.M, Lê Văn Hưng told his remaining soldiers that he did not want to endure a siege similar to what he had experienced at An Lộc in 1972, he later committed suicide and the defense of Can Tho was finished. IV Corps was dissolved shortly after the death of Lê Văn Hưng. On the same day, Brigadier General Trần Văn Hai committed suicide in Dong Tam Base Camp. \n\nParagraph 5: On April 20, 2022, the United States Army adopted the new Next Generation Squad Weapon, designated as the XM5 which will use a .278 inch bullet in a necked down 7.62×51mm NATO (colloquially .308 Winchester) case, the new cartridge is designated as 6.8 × 51 Common or alternatively known in the commercial market as the .277 Fury. The bullet size of the 6.8 × 51 cartridge is virtually identical to the bullet of the 7mm-08 Remington, the difference in diameter is less than 1/128 of an inch (0.2 mm) or approximately the thickness of two human hairs.  In addition as noted, both the 6.8 × 51 cartridge and the 7mm-08 Remington share the same parent case of the 7.62x51mm NATO (colloquially .308 Winchester), necked down to accept the respective bullet of each cartridge.  The most dramatic departure between these two cartridges concerns a new manufacturing technique used in relation to the 6.8 × 51 combat cartridge (designated as the 135 gr (9 g) Hybrid Match), which employs a stainless-steel cartridge head.   The 6.8 × 51 combat cartridge, with its new hybrid brass and stainless-steel case head can withstand case pressures up to 80,000 psi, which is significantly in excess of the pressures generated in a standard 7mm-08 Remington case and permits greater muzzle velocity and downrange energy when compared to the 7mm-08 Remington. As stated, the non-combat 6.8 × 51 cartridge (currently designated as the 135 gr (9 g) ELITE BALL FMJ) uses a conventional all-brass case and this non-combat cartridge is virtually the same as the 7mm-08 Remington except that the 6.8 × 51 cartridge 's bullet diameter is approximately 1/128 of an inch (0.2 mm) less in diameter.  In some ways, the 6.8 × 51 cartridge is actually closer to a true designation of \"7mm-08\" than the Remmington cartridge as the actual bullet diameter of the 6.8 × 51 common cartridge is 7.04 mm whereas the 7mm-08 Remington bullet diameter is a slightly larger 7.21 mm.\n\nParagraph 6: According to Dr. Karlwerner Kaiser, formerly of Speyer Archaeological Monument Care (Archäologische Denkmalpflege Speyer), knowledge and archaeological finds thus far gathered for the area within Herschweiler-Pettersheim's limits give no clue to any time before the 3rd or 4th century BC. The oldest find witnessed to date has been a bronze disk neckring. The still unknown recovery site is presumably a worn-down barrow from the 4th century BC. The find may well point to a Celtic estate, perhaps a \"knightly estate\", in the Ohmbach valley. Somewhat more than 200 years less old is a find consisting of a Celtic coin, which came from an unknown spot within municipal limits. It could bear witness, as a buried artifact from a settlement in the \"later, pre-Christian Bronze Age\" of the 1st or 2nd century BC, to a source in the floor of the dale or on the Ohmbach valley's slopes. It could somehow be linked to an ancient road that ran through the dale. Eventually, the digs at the Roman-era villa rustica on Seitersstraße in 1961 led to the unearthing of ceramics from a settlement of the \"later, pre-Christian Iron Age\" right near the Roman site. This points to a yet-to-be-unearthed Celtic estate at this spot dating from the 1st century BC, a forerunner to the already known Roman estate, which was built of stone. A Celtic settlement in the Ohmbach valley around today's Herschweiler-Pettersheim from the 3rd or 4th century BC melding into Roman times in the Palatinate is the picture that emerges from this. Even the name \"Hühnerkopf\", borne by the peak that looms over the village to the east, can be traced to the description Hünenkopf (or in Middle High German, Hunnenkopf – that is, \"Hun's Head\", whereas the modern form means \"Chicken's Head\") and is therefore a linguistic clue as to an ancient population and its particular connection with the mountain. The building of the villa rustica from Roman times after the beginning of the Christian Era on a graded layer of débris, unearthed in the years 1959-1961, in which building remnants and potsherds were found, proves that in the 2nd century AD, a great wooden building with clay-filled timber framing once stood at the spot, but later burnt down before being replaced by the Roman complex. The ceramics unearthed 30 m behind the villa rustica show that there was a Celtic settlement tradition from the \"later, pre-Christian Iron Age\" into what was locally Roman times, lasting into the latter half of the 3rd century AD. After the Germanic invasions and the villa's destruction in the late 3rd century, it is believed that the local area was not settled, and that virgin forest once again sprouted up on the site.\n\nParagraph 7: Bailey was born in Florissant, Missouri. He spent seven years of his childhood residing in Europe. Due to having lived in Europe, Bailey is fluent in German, Spanish (and sign language).

He eventually decided to pursue a career in acting while working on his doctoral degree at UCLA.\n\nParagraph 8:  Modern automobile engines are typically operated around  –  (33 Hz – 50 Hz) when cruising, with a minimum (idle) speed around 750 rpm – 900 rpm (12.5 Hz – 15 Hz), and an upper limit anywhere from 4500 rpm to  (75 Hz – 166 Hz) for a road car, very rarely reaching up to  for certain cars (such as the GMA T.50), or   for racing engines such as those in Formula 1 cars (during the  season, with the 2.4 L N/A V8 engine configuration; limited to , with the 1.6 L V6 turbo-hybrid engine configuration). The exhaust note of V8, V10, and V12 F1 cars has a much higher pitch than an I4 engine, because each of the cylinders of a four-stroke engine fires once for every two revolutions of the crankshaft. Thus an eight-cylinder engine turning 300 times per second will have an exhaust note of .\n\nParagraph 9: Porfirio Lobo Sosa (born 22 December 1947), known as Pepe Lobo, is a Honduran politician and agricultural landowner who served as President of Honduras from 2010 to 2014. A member of the conservative National Party and a former deputy in the National Congress of Honduras from 1990, he was president of the National Congress of Honduras from 2002 to 2006. He came second to Manuel Zelaya with 46% of the vote in the 2005 general election. After the military ousted Zelaya in a coup d'état, Lobo was elected president in the 2009 presidential election and took office on 27 January 2010.\n\nParagraph 10: The main occupation of the colonists was agriculture. With their arrival a massive cultivation of hemp started, although by some Turkish notebooks the cultivation of hemp was mentioned even when they ruled with these areas. The land in Odžaci and around was ideal for growing these plants, with the help of the river Mostonoga that was frequently casting and flooding the surrounding area. Also, Mostonoga was ideal for plunging the hemp. The production was initiated by baron Kotman who informed Vienna that the hemp succeeds well on the territory of the new colonist settlements. He gathered the hemp producers, he provided them with work means and obliged to purchase from them 5000 cubits of fabric annually. The production got more massive and Odžaci became one of the biggest centers for hemp production in Europe. In 1779 hemp fair was held for the first time and eventually became more significant. In 1907 a factory for cultivation of hemp and production of ropes was open by the members of a wealthy family Ertl (Franc and Johan) by the example of a similar factory in Segedin. The factory had initial 200 workers but it advanced rapidly and in 1929 reached a number of 800 employed. Eventually the production expanded so besides ropes they produced: carpets, and since 1933 wool and silk fabric."}

It begins with Charles Spearman's 1904 paper, which introduced a crude form of factor analysis that examined the appropriateness of a single factor model. Limited work on factor analysis followed until Thurstone published his paper in 1931, in which he expanded on Spearman's work to include multiple factors. In 1932, Hotelling presented a more accurate method of extracting factors called principal components analysis, but Thurstone rejected it due to distortions caused by setting commonalities to 1.0. Thurstone later presented the centroid method, which allowed for the analysis of a larger number of variables. He used tetrachoric correlation coefficients to estimate continuous variable correlations from dichotomous variables, and with his colleagues, published computing diagrams that reduced the calculations necessary for these coefficients. Thurstone's contributions were recognized at a 2004 conference, and his approach to factor analysis remains an important method in psychological research and other fields.

He was extrajudicially convicted by a troika, receiving a 10-year imprisonment sentence. During his imprisonment Bartini continued his work on new aircraft designs, first at the sharashka TsKB-29, an NKVD experiment aircraft design bureau in Moscow where he worked with Andrei Tupolev designing the Tupolev Tu-2, which became one of the most important Soviet aircraft of World War II. Bartini's Stal-7 plane also became the base for the Yermolayev Yer-2 bomber, also used by the Soviet Air Force during the war. When German troops were close to Moscow during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, TsKB-29 was moved from the city to Omsk where Bartini led his own design bureau, OKB-86. His bureau was disbanded in 1943, and he began working on various transport plane projects. Bartini was released in 1946, later working at the Dimitrov Aircraft Factory in Taganrog until 1952, when he became the chief engineer of advanced aircraft designs at the Scientific Research Institute in Novosibirsk. In 1956, during the De-Stalinization under Nikita Khrushchev, Bartini was officially rehabilitated by the Soviet state. The following year he was transferred to the OKBS MAP design bureau in Lyubertsy with Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin, and received backing from Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov, at the time the Minister of Defense of the USSR. Zhukov was forced out the position shortly afterwards, and most of the projects he backed were cancelled. In 1961, Bartini had proposed a nuclear-powered supersonic long-range reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nParagraph 4: Canobie Lake Park holds many events in the park throughout the year, including live performances and fireworks shows.

K. Gandhi in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights. The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians. The Commonwealth of India Bill, drafted by Annie Beasant in 1925, specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights – individual liberty, freedom of conscience, free expression of opinion, freedom of assembly, non-discrimination on the ground of sex, free elementary education and free use of public spaces. In 1927, the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a \"Swaraj Constitution\" for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression. The 11-member committee, led by Motilal Nehru, was constituted in 1928. Its report made a number of recommendations, including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians. These rights resembled those of the American Constitution and those adopted by post-war European countries, and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill. Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution, including the Fundamental Right itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, universal adult franchise, the abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement. Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru, the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement. The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus on minority rights – which had become an issue of major political concern by then – which were published in the Sapru Report in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a \"The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before the law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens. standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts\".\n\nParagraph 6: A promise is enforceable if it is supported by consideration, that is, where consideration has moved from the promisee. For example, in the case of Tweddle v Atkinson, John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn't receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine of privity of a contract, that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract's terms. (Note that the doctrine of privity has been somewhat altered by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1833, John Adams hired on as a wild animal collector with a group of showmen. Several menageries were active in the New England area at this time, probably the largest was the June, Titus Company's National Menagerie also known as, Grand National Menagerie. Boston, Massachusetts was the venue for many such menageries while Adams was living there, so he had the opportunity to meet and interact with the proprietors and performers. There were also circuses and menageries on the Pacific Coast when John reached California, one of which was the Joseph A. Rowe Olympic Circus that performed in San Francisco and Sacramento, California, at the time he arrived. On two occasions, Adams told Hittell he had contact with an acquaintance from New England. This person most likely was in some way connected to the circus/menagerie business. Adams told Hittell that the man was his brother, \"William\", although Adams didn't have a brother by that name. According to Earle Williams, the property that Adams ranched near Stockton, California, in 1852 was the same land that was later acquired by Henry C. Lee and John R. Marshall, proprietors of the Lee and Marshall Circus.  Lee hired a man by the name of David Howard to run the ranch which was about eight miles (13 km) southeast of Stockton, on Mariposa road. Grizzly Adams often left his stock and captured animals at \"Howard's Ranch\" to be cared for by Howard and Lee's circus people. Lee's circus used the ranch to keep their circus stock, wagons and other items in the circus' winter off-season. According to Williams when Grizzly Adams established his Mountaineer Museum in San Francisco, in 1856, the menagerie was a part of Lee's Circus, as a side show. Adams and a couple of his bears appeared with Rowe's Pioneer Circus in November. In 1857, Adams had a partner named Sheppard. In 1859, T. W. Tanner was a partner with Adams (this may have been the man who owned a half-interest in Adams' Pacific Museum, prior to Adams leaving for New York in January, 1860). When Adams arrived in New York City in April 1860, he discovered while talking with P.T. Barnum, that Barnum had bought the one-half interest of Adams' California Menagerie, (possibly from Tanner). On April 30, 1860, Adams and Barnum opened the California Menagerie in a canvas tent on the corner of Broadway and Fourth Street in New York City The show ran for six weeks. Adams health was failing, and he sold the remaining interest in the menagerie to Barnum. Adams then went on a summer tour of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire as part of Nixon & Company's Circus. He continued to perform with his bears and other trained animals until late October, 1860.\n\nParagraph 8: Based in the old Pacific Bell building on Rose Street at Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, California, Berkeley Systems grew to 120 employees and US$30 million annual revenue before it was acquired by the Sierra On-Line division of CUC International in 1997 for $13.8 million. Vivendi Universal’s subsequent acquisition of Sierra, and a host of similar enterprises, enjoined diverse competing sales and marketing departments with one sole directive: sell Web banner advertisements. As a result, Berkeley Systems became the U.S. headquarters of French-owned Flipside.com. In early 2000, Berkeley Systems was folded into the fledgling Los Angeles-based gambling site iWin.com, per the terms of that site's acquisition by Vivendi.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1904 Charles Spearman published a paper that largely founded the field of psychometrics and included a crude form of factor analysis that attempted to determine if a single factor model was appropriate. There was limited subsequent work on factor analysis until Thurstone published a paper in 1931 called Multiple Factor Analysis, which expanded Spearman's single-factor analysis to include more than one factor. In 1932, Hotelling presented a more accurate method of extracting factors, which he called principal components analysis. Thurstone rejected Hotelling's approach because it set the commonalities to 1.0, and Thurstone realized that will introduce distortions to the factor loadings when variables include unique components. Hotelling's method was also limited by the fact that it required too much calculation to be usable with more than about ten variables. A year after Hotelling's paper, Thurstone presented a more efficient way of extracting factors, called the centroid method, which allowed the factor analysis of a far larger number of variables. Later that year he gave his presidential address to the American Psychological Association wherein he presented the results of several factor analyses, including a factor analysis of 60 adjectives describing personality traits, showing how they could be reduced to five personality traits. He also presented analyses of 37 mental health symptoms, of attitudes towards 12 controversial social issues, and of 9 IQ tests. In those analyses, Thurstone had made use of tetrachoric correlation coefficients, a method for estimating continuous variable correlations from dichotomous variables. Tetrachorics require extensive calculations but in early 1933, he and two colleagues at the University of Chicago published a set of computing diagrams that greatly reduce the calculations needed for  those coefficients, another aspect of making his method of factor analysis practical with more than just a few variables. His 1933 presidential address was published in early 1934 with the title Vectors of the Mind. It lacked methodological and mathematical details of his technique, which is then the subject of this book. A 2004 conference called Factor Analysis at 100 produced a book with two chapters that document the historical importance Thurstone's contributions to factor analysis. Thurstone's approach to factor analysis remains an important method in psychological research and it has since been used in numerous other fields of study. It is now considered part of a family of methods for analyzing the covariance structure of variables, which includes principal components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.\n\nParagraph 10: Subiaul and colleagues, using two computerized tasks that measure the learning of two abstract rules: cognitive—item-based—rules (e.g., apple-boy-cat;) and motor-spatial-based rules (e.g., up-down-right) have shown that there are important dissociations between the imitation of these two types of rules. Specifically, results have shown that while 3-year-olds successfully imitate item-specific rules (i.e., cognitive imitation), these same 3-year-olds fail to imitate motor-spatial rules (i.e., motor-spatial imitation). This dissociation isn't because there's something inherently harder about learning spatial versus cognitive rules. Follow-up studies have shown that 3-year-olds easily learn new spatial rules by trial and error, correctly recalling such rules after a 30s delay, (Exp. 2). This result excludes the possibility that 3-year-olds' motor-spatial imitation problems are due to difficulty learning (i.e., encoding and recalling) novel spatial rules in general. In another study, 3-year-olds observed a model correctly touch the first item (e.g., Top Right) in the sequence, but then skip the middle item (e.g., Top Left picture) and, instead, touch the last item in the sequence (e.g., Bottom Left picture), resulting in an error, marked as unintentional by the model who said, \"Whoops! That's not right!\". This is a goal emulation learning condition, as the child had to copy the model's intended goal (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Left), rather than the observed (incorrect) response (Top-Right, Top-Left), similar to Meltzoff's \"re-enactment\" paradigm. When given an opportunity to respond, 3-year-olds generated the intended (i.e., correct) sequence (Exp. 3.) 3-year-old's success in the goal emulation condition excludes the possibility that 3-year-olds' motor-spatial imitation problem is due to difficulty vicariously learning (i.e., because of a lack of interest, failure to attend, problems inferring goals, etc.) a novel spatial rule from a model. Children's success in the goal emulation condition shows that social learning may be achieved by social reasoning (inferring goals) and causal inferences (error detection), independently of any domain-specific imitation learning mechanism."}

Unexpectedly, but in most cases of their own will, women began appearing on the battlefront in the middle of the ravages of war. Some of them took up arms (Milunka Savić, Sofija Jovanović, Antonija Javornik, Slavka Tomić and others) defending their fatherland no differently than men, showing surprising courage and valour. A larger number of women started volunteering in military and civilian hospitals. They were housewives, artists (Nadežda Petrović), writers (Danica Marković), doctors (like Draga Ljočić), semi-skilled nurses, caretakers, teachers; some of them were highly educated and others were not as fortunate but they were astute, skillful and quick-learners. What they had in common was an intense loyalty to their country and love for their people that suffered utter devastation during the Great War. Most Serbian nurses had completed crash courses on looking after the ill and wounded at in-patient clinics or makeshift military field hospitals and ad hoc dressing stations. Draginja Babić, Ljubica Luković, Kasija Miletić and Mirka Grujić worked as members of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, whereas others were organized as part of the Red Cross mission in Serbia and abroad to solicit aid (Helen Losanitch Frothingham). Women from foreign countries, the members of international medical missions, were also of great support to Serbian volunteers in their effort to help others. During the early stages of the conflict foreign missions arrived in Serbia from Great Britain and Scotland, the United States of America, France, Imperial Russia Switzerland, Australia, Denmark and the Netherlands. The members of the missions were mostly women – trained doctors and nurses – and they ran entire hospitals in the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro.

Together with their \"Samaritan sisters\" from Serbia, they used their medical knowledge and experience to help the Serbian army and in this way, they became part of the modern history of a small country from the Balkans and of the people who suffered the tragic Great Retreat over the treacherous Albanian mountains in the middle of 1915-1916 winter.\n\nParagraph 2: With very few feature films made in Canada at all prior to the 1960s, in some years no Film of the Year winner was named at all, with the awards for Best Short Film or Best Amateur Film instead constituting the highest honour given to a film that year. Even the award for Film of the Year, when presented at all, often also went to a short film. The awards were also almost totally dominated by the National Film Board, to the point that independent filmmakers sometimes alleged a systemic bias which was itself a contributing factor to the difficulty of building a sustainable commercial film industry in Canada. Particularly in the 1960s, television films were also eligible for the awards; in 1969, in fact, no theatrical films were entered into the awards at all, and the nominees and winners at the 21st Canadian Film Awards consisted almost entirely of television films. Despite the creation of the ACTRA Awards in 1972, the Canadian Film Awards continued to present selected \"non-feature\" awards, inclusive of television films, until the 1st Genie Awards in 1980. After launching the Genies, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television created the Bijou Awards, which were presented in 1981 as a new home for several award categories that were being dropped from the Genies, although the Bijous were never presented again after 1981, and instead the Gemini Awards were launched in 1986 to replace the ACTRAs as Canada's primary television awards.\n\nParagraph 3: The 1927 New York Yankees had perhaps the most feared line-up in the history of baseball.

He was complemented by future Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig at first base, who hit .373 with 47 home runs and a league-leading 175 RBI, Tony Lazzeri at second base who drove in 102 runs with a .309 average, and center fielder Earle Combs, who hit .356 and scored 137 runs as the team's leadoff hitter. Left fielder Bob Meusel also drove in over 100 runs, with a .337 average.\n\nParagraph 4: Chinese money trees (Traditional Chinese: 搖錢樹; Simplified Chinese: 摇钱树; Pinyin: yáo qián shù), or shengxianshu, (\"immortal ascension trees\"), are tree-like assemblies of charms, with the leaves made from numismatic charm replicas of cash coins. These money trees should not be with coin trees which are a by-product of the manufacture of cash coins, but due to their similarities it is thought by some experts that they may have been related. Various legends from China dating to the Three Kingdoms period mention a tree that if shaken would cause coins to fall from its branches. Money trees as a charm have been found in Southwest Chinese tombs from the Han dynasty, and are believed to have been placed there to help guide the dead to the afterlife and provide them with monetary support. According to one myth, a farmer watered the money tree seed with his sweat and watered its sapling with his blood, after which the mature tree provided eternal wealth; this implies a moral that one can only become wealthy through their own toil. Literary sources claim that the origin of the money tree lies with the Chinese word for \"copper\" (銅, tóng) which is pronounced similar to the word for \"the Paulownia tree\" (桐, tóng). The leaves of the Paulownia become yellow in autumn and take on the appearance of gold or bronze cash coins. Chen Shou (陳壽) mentions in the Records of the Three Kingdoms that a man named Bing Yuan (邴原) walked upon a string of cash coins while strolling and, unable to discover the owner, hung it in a nearby tree; other passersby noticed this string and began hanging coins in the tree with the assumption that it was a holy tree and made wishes for wealth and luck. The earliest money trees, however, date to the Han dynasty in present-day Sichuan and a Taoist religious order named the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Archeoloigsts uncovered money trees as tall as , decorated with many strings of cash coins, little bronze dogs, bats, Chinese deities, elephants, deer, phoenixes, and dragons, with a bronze frame and a base of pottery. Both the inscriptions and calligraphy found on Chinese money trees match those of contemporary Chinese cash coins, which typically featured replicas of Wu Zhu (五銖) coins during the Han dynasty while those from the Three Kingdoms period had inscriptions such as \"Liang Zhu\" (兩銖).\n\nParagraph 5: A traditional ship's wheel is composed of eight cylindrical wooden spokes (though sometimes as few as six or as many as ten) shaped like balusters and all joined at a central wooden hub or nave (sometimes covered with a brass nave plate) which housed the axle.  The square hole at the centre of the hub through which the axle ran is called the drive square and was often lined with a brass plate (and therefore called a brass boss, though this term was used more often to refer to a brass hub and nave plate) which was frequently etched with the name of the wheel's manufacturer. The outer rim is composed of sections each made up of stacks of three felloes, the facing felloe, the middle felloe, and the after felloe.  Because each group of three felloes at one time made up a quarter of the distance around the rim, the entire outer wooden wheel was sometimes called the quadrant. Each spoke ran through the middle felloe creating a series of handles beyond the wheel's rim.  One of these handles/ spokes was frequently provided with extra grooves at its tip which could be felt by a helmsman steering in the dark and used by him to determine the exact position of the rudder—this was the king spoke and when it pointed straight upward the rudder was believed to be dead straight to the hull.  The completed ship's wheel and associated axle and pedestal(s) might even be taller than the person using it. The wood used in construction of this type of wheel was most often either teak or mahogany, both of which are very durable tropical hardwoods capable of surviving the effects of salt water spray and regular use without significant decomposition. Modern design—particularly on smaller vessels—can deviate from the template.\n\nParagraph 6: Undredal Stave Church was built in the middle of the 12th century, possibly from the year 1147, but very likely from the mid- to late-1100s. There is some evidence that the church was taken apart and moved during the Middle Ages, but this is not known for sure. The original part of the church includes roughly the eastern 2/3rds of the present building. The original church had a  nave and a  chancel. Around the year 1600, the choir was rebuilt and enlarged, measuring about  after its completion. Originally, the church had a covered corridor that ran around the exterior of the church (as seen in many stave churches). This corridor was removed around 1685 and windows were installed in the walls of the nave. Around 1850, the building was extended to the west by lengthening the nave by about  and adding a new belltower and church porch on the west end of the newly enlarged nave. In 1862, the wall between the nave and chancel was removed and the ceiling was arched. The small 2nd floor seating gallery was also removed during this time. In 1913, there were plans to dismantle the church and move it to a museum in the village of Kaupanger (in Sogndal), but this never happened because money was never raised to replace the old church. Instead it was reconstructed in 1984 and underwent extensive maintenance work. Inside the church, the ceiling is decorated with biblical figures and angels.\n\nParagraph 7: During the late 20th century, the use of exonyms often became controversial. Groups often prefer that outsiders avoid exonyms where they have come to be used in a pejorative way. For example, Romani people often prefer that term to exonyms such as Gypsy (from the name of Egypt), and the French term  (from the name of Bohemia). People may also avoid exonyms for reasons of historical sensitivity, as in the case of German names for Polish and Czech places that, at one time, had been ethnically or politically German (e.g. Danzig/Gdańsk, Auschwitz/Oświęcim and Karlsbad/Karlovy Vary); and Russian names for non-Russian locations that were subsequently renamed or had their spelling changed (e.g. Kiev/Kyiv).\n\nParagraph 8: Scott Rubenstein was also co-owner of L.A. Tax Service (started in 1982) and worked as an Accountant and writer. He won Funniest Account in Los Angeles in the 1990s. Before his writing career began, Scott was a teacher in the Peace Corps, stationed in the Philippines. After returning home, he taught in Sacramento at Christian Brothers and he entered and won a writing contest through 20th Century Fox, which brought him to Los Angeles where he joined as a member of 20th century Fox's Comedy writing workshop. There be began his writing career and has written over 30 episodes of television. Scott co-wrote many episodes with this writing partner, Leonard Mlodinow. Scott co-wrote Peacock Blues with wife and director Devo Cutler-Rubenstein for Showtime and it won best Short Film at Moondance Film Festival. He also co-wrote the award winning documentary Not Afraid to Laugh. Scott has worked as an Adjunct Professor and taught Screen Writing, Comedy Writing and Screen Writing Adaptations in multiple settings, including at the California State University Northridge and University of Southern California. Scott and L.A. Tax Service was featured on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show in a segment called Hustle and Cash Flow and he played a small part on an episode of the New Girl as Mr. Scott Rubenstein. He was also a part of Improv workshops with Aretha Sills, the granddaughter of Viola Spolin. Scott was born in New York, New York to Jewish Parents. His father was a prisoner of war in World War II and held captive by the Japanese. His father was held as a prisoner in the Philippines and survived the Bataan Death March and the Hell Ships. His mother was a writer and bookkeeper. Scott has been best friends with Actor Sal Viscuso since they met while attending the University of California Davis (Scott graduated in 1969). He is survived by daughter Artist Sara Gavin and son Aaron Rubenstein, co-owner LA Tax.\n\nParagraph 9: In the Cartesian view, the distinction between these two concepts is a methodological necessity driven by a distrust of the senses and the res extensa as it represents the entire material world.  The categorical separation of these two, however, caused a problem, which can be demonstrated in this question: How can a wish (a mental event), cause an arm movement (a physical event)? Descartes has not provided any answer to this but Gottfried Leibniz proposed that it can be addressed by endowing each geometrical point in the res extensa with mind. Each of these points is within res extensa but they are also dimensionless, making them unextended. \n\nParagraph 10: As a society, they completed a plethora of different abolitionist activities, including writing letters, holding conventions, and circulating petitions. One of the first things they completed after founding was writing a letter to George Thompson because he inspired them to create the organization. George Thompson was a famous abolitionist who faced a lot of backlash for the progress he made in the anti-slavery movement. In the letter they wrote about how embarrassed they were that he was receiving such treatment, and let him know that they appreciated him and his work. However, in the First Annual reviews it explains that though the letter was sent, he never did write back. The Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society also sent a letter to the Ladies New York City Anti-Slavery Society accepting them as friends and hoping to join forces with other female anti-slave societies in New England. The groups would have more influence together to raise funds for the American Anti-Slave Society and could convince more southern women to support the movement. They collected funds for their society and the American Anti-Slavery Society. The funds allocated for the society also supported the Ladies Anti-Slavery Sewing Society, which was a smaller group under their original organization. This auxiliary sewed the society's slogan onto different items to gain support and bring attention to their group. They sold their sewed items to gain funds for the society. This included needlework and book covers with the slogan, “May the use of our needles prick the conscience of slaveholders.” Along with this they distributed Anti-slavery pamphlets and other publications. They sent and circulated petitions to Congress, pushing for abolition in the District of Columbia, and the group created and spread the Ladies petition to the general assembly that they had in 1836.  They also gave petitions to the Presbyterian church general assembly and they circulated Anti-Slavery Tracts.  In 1836, the society held lectures to gain support for their cause and had the Grimké Sisters speak in their event, which they hoped would create a bigger audience for their society. This was originally a series of parlor lectures, but there were too many people interested and they needed to find a bigger space. The event moved to the succession room of Reverend Duncan Dunbar's Beriah Baptist Church. They wanted this meeting to just include women so they would escort men out when they entered. While they were in operation, they also hosted a national convention that lasted 4 days in 1937. They sent 18 delegates and 80 members. They did not lead the convention, they hosted it, but they were one of the more conservative groups that participated."}

The fawn fled to the ashrama of Sage Kanva, and the king followed it. Upon reaching the ashrama, the king saw Shakuntala watering the plants, accompanied by her friends, named Anasuya and Priyamvada. Dushyanta and Shakuntala fell in love with each other. Since the sage Kanva was absent from the ashrama, they married according to the gandharva rites, and Shakuntala soon became pregnant. The king presented her with his signet ring, and left for his palace. When Dushyanta left Shakuntala, she grew pensive, and did not realise the arrival of Durvasa to the ashrama. Reputed for his anger, Durvasa took her ignorance of him as a sign of disrespect, and cursed her to be forgotten by the man she was contemplating at that very moment. Shakuntala did not hear this curse being placed upon her. When Kanva returned and learnt of these events, he sent Shakuntala to the palace of Dushyanta. Owing to the curse, Dushyanta did not recognised her. Greatly aggrieved, while Shakuntala was returning to the ashrama, her mother, Menaka, took her to the ashrama of Kashyapa. Shakuntala delivered a son. The boy grew brave and fearless, and was able to subdue even the wildest of beasts in the region. Kashyapa, therefore, named him Sarvadamana (all-subduing). After a period of time, when Dushyanta was returning home after visiting Indra, he came across Shakuntala, recognised her, and took her and his son to his palace. This boy grew up to become Bharata. Bharata conquered the world, and acquired three wives, though the sons born of these wives were so cruel that they were slain. Bharata propitiated the devas for a son, and they gave him a boy, whom he named Vitatha, also called Bharadvaja. According to another account, Bharadvaja blessed Bharata with a son named Bhumanyu. Bharata ruled for twenty-seven thousand years, and therefore, the kingdom that he inherited and expanded came to be known as Bhārata, named after him.\n\nParagraph 3: Liz Wyatt of CBR.com referred to Lockjaw as one of Marvel's \"fan favorite animal companions,\" stating, \"Lockjaw is perhaps the cutest Inhuman out there...though we might be biased on that count. Lockjaw is not only extremely adorable, loyal, and okay...he's massive as well, but he's also very useful. You see, Lockjaw can teleport almost as well as he can drool. Which is saying something! Lockjaw is a massive bulldog, and an Inhuman to boot. He's made friends and allies with more than one Marvel character, and we're not surprised by that fact. This is one dog who has plenty of room for love in his heart. And that is why we love him so much.\" Chase Magnett of Comicbook.com called Lockjaw \"one of the longest-lasting and most beloved super pets in existence,\" writing, \"The bottom line with Lockjaw is that he's a very good dog. One of the best. If there were a We Rate Dogs Twitter in the Marvel universe, it would almost certainly give Lockjaw a 15/10. As a character, he reminds us of everything we love about our canine companions with an extra dose of superheroic powers and adventure on top. Lockjaw is loyal and loving, filled with fun, and there whenever his people need him. Whether you have a dog in your home or prefer to admire them from afar, the appeal of the species is obvious when looking at this big, jowled face. He's just such a good dog.\" CA Staff of ComicsAlliance asserted, \"It's hard to imagine anyone not loving Lockjaw. He's a huge puppy dog who teleports you to where you need to go! He's so smart that for a while the story was that he wasn't a dog at all — but thankfully that was retconned, because Lockjaw is the best dog, and not letting him be one kind of ruins him. He's loyal to the Inhuman Royal Family — he even has a tuning fork on his head to match his master — but he's also spent time with the Thing and Ms. Marvel, two of Marvel's best characters. who are made even better with Lockjaw around. He may not star in many stories of his own, but if you could magically wish one comics character to life and hang out with them, Lockjaw would be an excellent choice.\" Simon Winter of WhatCulture said, \"Despite being a dog, Lockjaw is by far the best member of the Inhumans. As 'Companion to the Royal Family of the Inhumans', Lockjaw plays an important part in keeping New Attilan safe from the countless threats it faces. However, if you think he's just a giant slobbering eating machine... Well, you'd be mostly right, but there's way more to this lovable mutt than meets the eye. In one of Marvel's greatest decisions, Lockjaw got his own Avengers team in 2009's Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers.\"\n\nParagraph 4: From 1968-1974, he studied at the Faculty of Law, Yerevan State University. In the years 1974 to 1987, he worked as an Inspector, Senior Inspector, Leading Inspector at the ASSR Ministry of Social Security. In 1981-1983, it was decreed that Yesayan was a Declaimer at the Chair of Social and Labor Eligibility at the All-Union Distance Learning Institute of Law (Moscow). In 1987-1990, he occupied the position of senior consultant in the Forgiveness Department of the Armenian SSR Supreme Council Presidium. On 20 September 1990 RA Supreme Council assigned Ashot Yesayan RA Minister of Labor and Social Security. From October 1995 till August 1997, he was appointed the Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Security of the Republic of Armenia. In the period from 23 January 1999 to February 2000, he was Chief Assistant to the RA General Prosecutor, simultaneously holding the post of the Head of the RA General Prosecutor's Secretariat. On 15 March 1999 he got the classification Grade of Counselor of the 2nd class. On 21 February 2000 Ashot Yesayan was appointed the Deputy Minister of Social Security of the Republic of Armenia by the Prime Minister Decision and the First Deputy Minister of Social Security of the Republic of Armenia since 17 July  2000. In the years 1990 to 1995, the Pension and Employment Fund (present-day State Social Security Service), Employment and Social Services were founded under his direct supervision, as well as hundreds of laws and sub legislative acts have been developed and presented to the consideration of the RA National Assembly and RA Government, and the concept of social policy in the transition period towards free market was realized and the social policy program implemented in the period 1992-1995. Besides that, Ashot Yesayan was the ideologist and coordinator of Paros System Implementation (grading system of needy people). He is the author of nearly one hundred articles. On Yesayan’s own initiative, Armenia has become a member of the International Labor Organization since November 1993. Here is the list of the posts Ashot Yesayan once held: Co-president of Armenia's Orphanages Foundation (1993), Head of the public organization Hraparak aimed at social dialogue and support (since 1997), independent expert of the UN Development Agency (1999). Ashot Yesayan marked the social situation of the past 5 years in the Republic, especially meeting the poverty reduction objectives. Moreover, it was recognized the first among all HDR reports and got 2 prizes out of 4 in the year 2000 (Brazil). He has been the President of the Board of Trustees of SOS Children's Villages Armenian Charity Foundation since 1997. During the years 1998-2000, Ashot Yesayan headed the Project “Struggle against children's begging” implemented by the Fund of Armenian Relief. He has been Deputy Team Leader of the Government's PRSP since 2001; thus he led the PRSP Group responsible for drafting technical tasks. Ashot Yesayan was also a member at Human Rights' Office under the RA President, at the local self-government offices' and the RA charitable programs' committees.\n\nParagraph 5: Two-time and defending champion Contador was one of the riders frequently cited as a major favorite to win the Tour de France. Contador was sixth in the prologue time trial, positioning himself near prospective rivals and his former teammates Lance Armstrong and Levi Leipheimer despite the short, flat course not particularly favoring Contador's strengths. Contador and Vinokourov both limited their losses well in stage 3, which incorporated numerous sectors of cobblestones at the Belgium-France border. Vinokourov was tenth on the day, finishing with the second group 53 seconds back of the stage winner. Contador had been with this group for most of the cobbled sections, but he flatted towards the finish and lost a further 20 seconds. Nonetheless, both riders occupied spots in the top ten after the stage, Vinokourov in eighth and Contador in ninth. After three stages decided by field sprints, the medium mountain seventh stage to Station des Rousses in the Jura began to sort out the overall standings. Vinokourov, Contador, and all serious overall contenders finished together on the same time. They moved up to fifth and sixth overall as some sprinters who were still highly placed because of the Tour's flat first week fell from the top of the standings. In the first Alpine stage the next day, the race's elite (with the notable exception of Lance Armstrong) contested the stage as the first group on the road. Andy Schleck and Samuel Sánchez attacked within the stage's final kilometer and gained 10 seconds against the other overall favorites, including Contador, with Schleck winning the stage. Contador moved up to third overall with the day's results. In the next stage, after the first rest day, Contador and Schleck made a move which ensured that they would finish in the top two spots on the podium at the end of the race. On the Col de la Madeleine, an hors catégorie climb (and the fourth of the day), the two broke away from the race's other overall contenders. They met and bridged up to Jens Voigt, a member of the morning escape, who paced them (on Schleck's behalf) to a sizeable gap over the peloton they had left behind. Though Sánchez also gained time against this group, the day's results put Schleck in first and Contador in second with more than two minutes between Contador and Sánchez in third, all but assuring that one of them would be Tour champion.\n\nParagraph 6: Cumbey offered the first major criticism of the New Age movement from a Christian perspective in The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and Our Coming Age of Barbarism (1983), but quickly lost academic credibility due to her promotion of conspiracy theories linking the New Age movement to Benjamin Creme, theosophy and Nazism. Scholar of New Age religion James R. Lewis describes this book as containing \"a few few insightful criticisms with many accusations of the least responsible sort\", and that she is \"simply lumping together anything that departs from a rather strict interpretation of Christianity.\" Cumbey's accusations include that the New Age movement has \"infiltrated all of Christianity, as well as Judaism\", and that it is the motivating force behind ecumenism, holistic health centers, New Thought, humanistic psychology, Montessori schools, modernism, secular humanism, and zero population growth. She states that Unitarian churches and health food stores become \"New Age recruiting centers\", that the Guardian Angels become one of the New Age movement's paramilitary organizations and that \"the New Age Movement has complete identity with the programs of Hitler\". Her contention is that the New Age movement is not simply expressing a naive or unscriptural interest in metaphysics, but that it is an organized conspiracy to overthrow the United States and replace it with a Nazi-like regime.\n\nParagraph 7: Between 1976–77 and 1981–82 Albert Rovers played in the League of Ireland.  In September 1976 Albert Rovers were elected to the league as replacements for Cork Hibernians. The team was managed by Noel O'Mahony and they made their League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers at Flower Lodge on 3 October 1976. Albert Rovers had requested the game be moved to avoid a clash with the Cork Senior Hurling Championship final but Shamrock Rovers refused. The visitors won 2–1 with Larry Wyse and Mick Leech scoring their goals. The 1977–78 season saw the League of Ireland team adopt the name Cork Albert and for 1978–79 they became Cork Alberts. As Cork Albert the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a second time in 1977–78, defeating Limerick in the final. They were finalists in the 1977–78 League of Ireland Cup but lost out to Dundalk on penalties. England international Bobby Tambling finished his playing career with Cork Alberts while John Meyler also played for the club during this era. Following the demise of Cork Celtic in 1979, the club was Cork city's sole representative in the League of Ireland and the team adopted the name Cork United for the 1979–80 season. The club retained the Cork United name for the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. Cork United managed to sign some notable players including Miah Dennehy, Ian Callaghan and Ian Hutchinson but they never managed to make the move beyond mid-table. As Cork United the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979–80 and 1981–82. In the finals they defeated Crosshaven and Waterford respectively. In December 1981 the club invested heavily in bringing Manchester City to Turners Cross for a friendly. Hampered by postponements and cancellations, the club slipped into debt and they were unable to pay Manchester City their £8,000 appearance fee. As a result, they were subsequently expelled from the League of Ireland.\n\nParagraph 8: Paeonia daurica was first described by Henry Cranke Andrews in the seventh volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P. wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P. wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P. corallina and P. corallina var. triternata, and P. wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P. triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P. corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P. wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow was the first to think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P. wittmanniana to P. corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P. corallina, P. mlokosewitschii, P. macrophylla, P. wittmanniana, and introduced P. wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P. triternata and P. corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P. corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P. wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P. mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P. corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P. mlokosewitschii, P. wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and the new P. abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P. mlokosewitschii – as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets – and P. triternata, P. caucasica, P. wittmanniana, P. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and P. abchasica – all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P. daurica, P. mlokosewitschii and P. wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P. kavachensis (= P. caucasica), P. mlokosewitschii (including P. tomentosa) and P. wittmanniana (including P. abchasica). P. wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P. steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P. abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P. ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.\n\nParagraph 9: Cooper's conviction and death sentence has been highly controversial, garnering repeated attention from both Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times and Erin Moriarty on the CBS News program \"48 Hours.\" There have been accusations that Cooper received an inadequate defense, as well as prosecutorial misconduct such as destruction of evidence, withholding exculpatory evidence from the defense, planting of evidence, brainwashing to witnesses, and perjured testimony by the Sheriff's Department. There have also been practical questions raised, such as how Cooper, at 155 pounds, and allegedly acting alone, overpowered a 6-foot, 2-inch ex-military policeman and his athletic wife, both of whom had loaded firearms close at hand.  It has also been questioned why a single perpetrator would use 3 or 4 different weapons to commit the murders, and why none of the victims were able to run away while the others were being attacked.\n\nParagraph 10: Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government in their new capital of Kamina City. As soon as the human population reaches one million people by the amount on the surface, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce their intentions: they have sent the Moon onto a collision course with the Earth as part of their effort to wipe out all life on the planet, so as to prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. It turns out that Lordgenome, having since been resurrected as a bio-computer, was once part of an intergalactic army of warriors that failed to stop the Anti-Spirals, and so forced mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals. With guidance from Lordgenome and help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, in the process revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension the Anti-Spirals had hidden it in, and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld. After a journey with significant loss, they rescue Nia, and in a one-on-one Gunmen battle that virtually spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away into nothing, as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals, a fate she and Simon accept. With his life in battle finally over, Simon hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and leaves his friends to spend the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant, saying his destiny was merely to \"dig the tunnel to the future\", not to travel down it himself."}
{"queries": ["In this text, a couple and their daughter encounter a disturbed farmer named Lamont who tells them about strange happenings in the valley since a meteor landed. Lamont explains that he is unable to leave his property because the plants and rocks have become possessed. The couple spends the night at Lamont's house, experiencing terrifying encounters with tumbleweeds and frogs. They discover Lamont's diary, which reveals his awareness of an alien presence. When they try to return to their car, they are attacked by living rocks, and Lamont is seemingly killed. Back at the farmhouse, Lamont returns in a trance-like state, possessed by the unknown entity. The husband decides that the only way to escape is to try to communicate with the possessor. Through self-hypnosis, he makes contact and briefly becomes possessed by the alien mind, which expresses frustration at its unsuccessful attempts to communicate with humans. The alien eventually departs, and everything returns to normal. The couple is able to leave and on their way home, the husband reflects on the vast distance between humans and the alien intelligence.", "Sucker Punch Productions was founded in 1997 by a group of former Microsoft employees who were dissatisfied with their careers and wanted to start a video game company. The name \"Sucker Punch\" was chosen despite initial objections from one of the team members' wives, as it was believed to appeal to the target audience of young men. The team initially planned to develop a game for Nintendo 64, but later abandoned this idea. Two of the founders left the company in 1998.", "The text explains that cyclopropanones, which are three-membered ring ketones, undergo hydration to a significant extent. This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals."], "answers": ["Paragraph 4", "Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 10"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Déjacque moved to New York in 1854 where, marked by the defeat of 1848, he violently denounced societal injustices - in particular the exploitation and the miserable living conditions of the proletariat, calling for a social revolution. His reflections on individual existence in the industrial and capitalist world led him to develop an original theory of universality and to advocate an uncompromising anarchist policy. In 1855, he signed the inaugural manifesto of an International association, which brought together French socialists, German communists, English chartists and was considered a predecessor of the International Workingmen's Association. Whilst staying in New Orleans from 1856 to 1858, he wrote his famous anarchist utopia L'Humanisphère, Utopie anarchique, but could not find a publisher. Returning to New York he was able to serialise his book in his periodical Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement social. Published in 27 issues from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861, Le Libertaire was the first anarcho-communist journal published in America. This was the first anarchist journal to use the term \"libertarian\". An uncompromising anarchist, Joseph Déjacque rejected any system of political representation or delegation that would lead the individual to abdicate his will by letting another express himself in his place. A partisan of the most complete freedom which he called \"individual sovereignty\", Déjacque is also known to have called for gender equality, in response to the misogyny of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.\n\nParagraph 2: Sucker Punch Productions was founded in October 1997 by Brian Fleming, Chris Zimmerman, Bruce Oberg, Darrell Plank, Tom Saxton, and Cathy Saxton, who first met while they worked at Microsoft. Zimmerman was \"disenchanted\" with his career in Microsoft and wanted to do something different. He approached co-workers Fleming and Oberg and shared his idea about starting a video game company. The brand name was created from one of several names the team had unsuccessfully proposed as project codenames at Microsoft. Zimmerman shared the name options with his wife to get her opinion, and she advised the team not to use Sucker Punch as the studio's name. The team went against her advice since the target audience for video games at that time was mostly young men, a group which the name Sucker Punch would resonate with. After the establishment of the studio, the team began working on their first game. Seeing the release of games like Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PlayStation, the team felt they lacked the necessary skills and experience to compete with them. Instead, the team decided to develop their new game for Nintendo 64, codenamed Puzzle Factory. This first game was inspired by a computer game named The Incredible Machine and was to feature 3D visuals, but the plan was scrapped. Two of the founders, Tom and Cathy Saxton, left Sucker Punch Productions in 1998.\n\nParagraph 3: As part of the reregistration process, the U.S. EPA reviewed all toxicity studies on vinclozolin. The main effect induced by vinclozolin is related to its antiandrogenic activity and its ability to act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor.  Vinclozolin can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that vinclozolin itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3 mg/kg/day) of vinclozolin, effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano-genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, it has been shown that the antiandrogenic effects of vinclozolin are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17.  Embryonic exposure to vinclozolin can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, vinclozolin and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. Vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like vinclozolin can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to vinclozolin in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, antiandrogenic effects would be expected in humans.\n\nParagraph 4: At this point they are saved by a severely disturbed (possibly schizophrenic) farmer named Lamont, who explains that things have been awkward in the valley ever since a \"meteor\" landed two weeks before, causing his farm to be destroyed.  Lamont tells them he stayed merely out of curiosity, but now the possessed weeds, trees and rocks won't allow him to leave either. The three make their way to Lamont's house where they spend a frightening night surrounded by tumbleweeds first, and then thousands of frogs. The wife discovers Lamont's diary containing eloquent and intelligent passages regarding his awareness of an apparent alien presence.  In the morning, they walk back to the car without trouble, only to be attacked by living rocks once they get there. One rock apparently kills Lamont. The couple run back to the farmhouse, where Lamont eventually returns and sits down in a chair, remaining motionless, speechless and in a trance-like state, with the couple trying to rouse him, and then realizing that he has been possessed by an unknown entity. The husband then decides that the only way they are ever to escape is to attempt to communicate with whatever is behind the possessions. The husband manages to make contact through self-hypnosis, and is briefly possessed by what appears to be a non-corporeal alien mind that came to Earth out of mere curiosity, but failed to establish communication. The extraterrestrial presence bemoans its vain attempt at communicating with humans and eventually departs after transmitting the idea that mankind perhaps needs more time to evolve in order to communicate with it. After its departure, everything returns to normal, allowing the couple to return to their car. On their way home, the husband compassionately philosophises that, while both of them are only a few miles away from their home, the alien intelligence must be far further from its own.\n\nParagraph 5: Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania and spent his childhood in Meadville. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941. Following brief stints practicing law in New York City and Meadville and United States Navy service as an intelligence officer and on PT boats during World War II, Shafer entered politics as a district attorney in 1948 and then as a state senator. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, under Governor Bill Scranton. Shafer was active in that role and succeeded the term-limited Scranton as governor in the 1966 election. Shafer became a prominent voice among moderate Republicans and oversaw constitutional reforms in Pennsylvania, the formation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, expenditures for health and education programs, and proposed a state income tax, which proved unpopular but was later enacted by his successor, Milton Shapp.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1812, Mavrokordatos went to the court of his uncle John George Caradja, Hospodar of Wallachia, with whom he passed into exile in the Austrian Empire (1818), where he studied at the University of Padua. He was a member of the Filiki Eteria and was among the Phanariot Greeks who hastened to Morea on the outbreak of the War of Independence in 1821. At the time of the beginning of the revolution, Mavrokordatos was living in Pisa with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley, and upon hearing of the revolution, Mavrokordatos headed to Marseilles to buy arms and a ship to take him back to Greece. Mavrokordatos was a very wealthy, well educated man, fluent in seven languages, whose experience in ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a future leader of Greece. Unlike many of the Greek leaders, Mavrokordatos, who had lived in the West, preferred to wear Western clothing, and looked towards the West as a political model for Greece. The American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe described Mavrokordatos:\"His manners are perfectly easy and gentlemanlike and though the first impression would be from his extreme politeness and continual smiles that he was a good-natured silly fop, yet one soon sees from the keen inquisitive glances which involuntarily escape from him, that he is concealing, under an almost childish lightness of manner, a close and accurate study of his visitor... His friends ascribe every action to the most disinterested patriotism; but his enemies hesitate not to pronounce them all to have for their end his party or private interest... Here, as is often the case, truth lies between the two extremes\". Mavokordhatos, a crafty, intelligent man was the best politician thrown up by the Greek struggle and he dominated directly or indirectly the various assemblies that endeavoured to establish a government for Greece. He was active in endeavouring to establish a regular government, and in January 1822 he was elected by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus as the \"President of the Executive\", making him in effect Greece's leader. The Epidaurus assembly was largely Mavrokordatos's triumph as he wrote the first Greek constitution and become the new national leader. Reflecting the fact that the Greek government had little power, Mavrokordatos was more interested in defending his power base in West Rumeli (Continental Greece), going first to the island of Hydra to secure the support of the Hydriots' warships and then to Missolonghi, where he supervised the building of the defensive works while using his wealth to create a network of patronage designed to secure him support from the western Rumeliot clans. Mavrokordatos did not play the part of a national leader, and had created a deliberately complicated constitution largely to ensure that no one else could become a successful leader while he was off securing his power base in West Rumeli. One observer commented about Mavrokordatos's tactics: \"He imitates the cunning of the hedgehog who, they say, flattens his needles and makes himself thin to enter his burrow, and once inside fluffs them out again and becomes a ball of prickles to stop anyone else getting in\".\n\nParagraph 7: Miller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi, as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left him to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as his ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade, where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take him out, feuding with Scott Norton. For a time, he started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had \"purchased\", but it was short-lived, and he soon returned to his James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn, with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting him with a crowbar. He and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash, but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan, who Miller defeated after kicking him with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe.\n\nParagraph 8: The group then sent a petition to Abdu'l-Bahá to approach for Baháʼí pilgrimage October 10, written by Lua and carried by Kheiralla who arrived November 11 after a stay in Egypt and meeting with his family there.Kindle:490,507,2602,2619 They were advised to arrive in small groups, ultimately three groups arrived, over several weeks because of restricted living conditions.Kindle:1786 The Getsingers left right after celebrating Thanksgiving,  and went from France to Italy and left via Naples on ,Kindle:2179 which made weekly trips to Alexandria, Egypt. so arriving probably December 2.

Lua recorded: After being directed for all to sit together for a bit, he then sent Lua to the chambers of his sister, Bahíyyih Khánum; still she couldn’t sleep that night until morning. Later the next day she visited the Ridván Garden in ‘Akká: \"…we were permitted to enter this also, to go into the room which He always occupied,[ed - Baháʼu'lláh] kneel before the chair upon which He sat, and to kiss the place upon which the soles of His feet rested!“ Then the group went on to the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh led by Abdu'l-Bahá and she was given flowers by Abdu'l-Bahá for the American Baháʼís, was given a lesson in spiritualizing actions by being served by Abdu'l-Bahá instead of them serving him, when they returned she had her first long sleep since arriving, and then the group returned to Haifa. Lua and her husband were the first North American Baháʼís to go on Baháʼí pilgrimage. This visit began December 10, 1898, at the House of `Abdu'lláh Páshá. Edward took many pictures in the area.Kindle:615-648,3076, 3083, 3101, 3187,4217 The Getsingers did not stay in ‘Akká at the time - Abdu'l-Bahá arranged for them to stay in Haifa that he would use going forward for other occasions.Kindle:2756\n\nParagraph 9: In 1846 Charlotte, Emily and Anne used part of their Aunt Branwell's legacy to finance the publication of their poems, concealing their true identities under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Poems was published by Aylott and Jones, but only two copies were sold. Charlotte's first attempt at writing a novel for publication, The Professor, was rejected by several publishing houses, before Smith, Elder & Co. declined to accept it but were encouraging enough for Charlotte to send them her next work, Jane Eyre. It was accepted and published on 19 October 1847. Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey had been accepted by the London publisher, Thomas Cautley Newby and appeared as a three-volume set in December 1847. After Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte and Anne were forced to reveal their true identities. Their brother, Branwell, who had become dependent on alcohol and opium for solace, had developed tuberculosis and died suddenly on Sunday 24 September 1848, aged 31. Emily was also dying from the disease, and never left the house after Branwell's funeral. She died aged 30 on 19 December 1848. Anne too had tuberculosis and was taken to Scarborough to try a sea cure but died four days after arriving on 28 May 1849, aged 29 years (Anne's gravestone mistakenly marks her age as 28 when she died).\n\nParagraph 10: Cyclopropanones- three-membered ring ketones- are also hydrated to a significant extent. Since three-membered rings are very strained (bond angles forced to be 60˚), sp3 hybridization is more favorable than sp2 hybridization. For the sp3 hybridized hydrate the bonds have to be distorted by about 49˚, while for the sp2 hybridized ketone the bond angle distortion is about 60˚. So the addition to the carbonyl group allows some of the strain inherent in the small ring to be released, which is why cyclopropanone and cyclobutanone are very reactive electrophiles. For larger rings, where the bond angles are not as distorted, the stability of the hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. Formation of an acyclic acetal involves a decrease in entropy because two molecules are consumed for every one produced. In contrast, the formation of cyclic hemiacetals involves a single molecule reacting with itself, making the reaction more favorable. Another way to understand the stability of cyclic hemiacetals is to look at the equilibrium constant as the ratio of the forward and backward reaction rate. For a cyclic hemiacetal the reaction is intramolecular so the nucleophile is always held close to the carbonyl group ready to attack, so the forward rate of reaction is much higher than the backward rate. Many biologically relevant sugars, such as glucose, are cyclic hemiacetals.       "}

He served in this capacity for the next four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No. 77 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No. 38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General's Flight (later No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron) until 1956. As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Promoted to squadron leader, Evans's service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13 June 1957. The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture.

This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, D.C., as assistant air attaché, having \"had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements\".\n\nParagraph 2: The operation started on the evening of 1 April with engagement to start shortly after midnight. The lagoon crossing (marked in advance though not too successfully by Combined Operations Pilotage Party 2 and M Squadron, Special Boat Service), took far longer than planned due to the exceptionally low water level and exceptionally muddy lagoon bottom, which was as deep as chest high. The Commandos struggled through the muddy waste all night, manhandling their boats, and eventually reached the Spit at first light, over 4 hours behind schedule. Exhausted and covered in glutinous slime they pressed home their attacks. Nos. 2, 40 and 43 Commandos all made their objectives relatively as expected although the Germans succeeded in blowing-up one bridge before it was captured by No.2 Commando. No. 9 Commando initially made good progress until No. 5 and No. 6 Troops (especially 5 Troop), became seriously pinned down across a killing ground while attempting to capture the enemy position 'Leviticus', (all physical references were given biblical names in this operation). 1 and 2 Troops made good progress down the centre of the Spit and when advised of the situation of 5 and 6 Troops, bypassed Leviticus in order to turn about. They laid smoke, and conducted a bayonet charge, from the southeast. The German position was overrun despite the smoke clearing too quickly exposing the Commandos during the last 150 metres. Routed German defenders who had fled north, fell into the waiting Bren guns of 6 Troop. The bayonet charge was accompanied by 1 Troop’s piper playing ’The Road to the Isles’.\n\nParagraph 3: Of the 12 crewmen in the bow of the airship, only three survived. Four of these 12 men were standing on the mooring shelf, a platform up at the very tip of the bow from which the forwardmost landing ropes and the steel mooring cable were released to the ground crew, and which was directly at the forward end of the axial walkway and just ahead of gas cell #16. The rest were standing either along the lower keel walkway ahead of the control car, or else on platforms beside the stairway leading up the curve of the bow to the mooring shelf. During the fire the bow hung in the air at roughly a 45-degree angle and flames shot forward through the axial walkway, bursting through the bow (and the bow gas cells) like a blowtorch. The three men from the forward section who survived (elevatorman Kurt Bauer, cook Alfred Grözinger, and electrician Josef Leibrecht) were those furthest aft of the bow, and two of them (Bauer and Grözinger) happened to be standing near two large triangular air vents, through which cool air was being drawn by the fire. Neither of these men sustained more than superficial burns. Most of the men standing along the bow stairway either fell aft into the fire, or tried to leap from the ship when it was still too high in the air. Three of the four men standing on the mooring shelf inside the very tip of the bow were actually taken from the wreck alive, though one (Erich Spehl, a rigger) died shortly afterwards in the Air Station's infirmary, and the other two (helmsman Alfred Bernhard and apprentice elevatorman Ludwig Felber) were reported by newspapers to have initially survived the fire, and then to subsequently have died at area hospitals during the night or early the following morning.\n\nParagraph 4: The supply chains that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic faced huge challenges and struggled to recover. Industries around the world shutdown due to the rapid spread of the virus in 2020. There was reduced industrial activity and lower consumer demand. While consumer demand increased quickly when lockdowns were lifted, manufacturers and distributors of goods were stymied by worker shortages and a lack of key components and raw materials. Additional bottlenecks included containers, shipping, trucks, railroads and warehouses. Ports around the world were impacted with ports in the United States in particular experiencing blockages as they were overwhelmed with container ships and their cargo. The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles together account for approximately 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States. More than three-quarters of the containers leaving Los Angeles were empty in July 2021 whereas about two-thirds of the containers leaving U.S. ports are typically filled with exports. Many of containers were going back empty due to the rush by shippers to bring in imports of back-to-school supplies and fall fashions from Asia. This impacted Midwestern farmers and California almond growers who ship to customers overseas. Shipping companies placed a lower priority on products that paid lower shipping rates resulting in various exports being delayed. In October, there were a record number of ships at the docks of these two Los Angeles area ports as well a record number of ships waiting for a slip. In early November, more than 100 ships were anchored in San Pedro Bay. It was unusual for even one vessel to be waiting offshore before the coronavirus pandemic. In late 2021 and the first month of 2022, container ships have remained at American ports unloading goods for seven days on average, 21 percent higher than at the start of the pandemic. The mayhem at ports and shipping yards was a key driver for rising prices together with the market dominance of major companies. In early 2022, politicians and central bankers worked to tame inflation as businesses continued to struggle to manufacture and distribute their products. By July the total value of trade stuck on the water off the east and west coast ports was estimated at roughly $30 billion. Another $1.5 billion in trade was waiting for rail service at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles which was 60% of all containers waiting at these ports. By September 2022, the backlog at U.S. ports decreased partially due to slowing U.S. import volumes amid high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nParagraph 5: Calvin Zabo was born in Trenton, New Jersey and becomes a morally abject, but brilliant biochemist who discovered the effects of hormones on human physiology. His favorite storybook is Stevenson's 1886 classic, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. He convinced himself that the experiment Dr. Jekyll performed in the story could actually be accomplished and obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this, so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community got suspicious for his tendency of always getting employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. Zabo eventually sought work as a surgeon in the hospital where Donald Blake, now a directing physician, yet would not allow him that job due to his history. Zabo became so enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did indeed intend to rob the organization, and swore revenge. He even became successful in creating his formula and turned himself into a massive, Hulk-like creature he called Mister Hyde, named after the character in the novel. In this new form, Hyde found out he had immense strength allowing him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, whom he tried to kill by throwing him from a window, but Blake transformed into Thor by striking his cane on the wall and survived, with Thor claiming that he have saved Blake. Hyde, hearing of this on the radio, decided to eliminate Thor. He tried framing him for a bank robbery by using his vast strength to rip open a bank vault while disguised as Thor. While Blake and Jane Foster were out, Hyde met and kidnapped them at gunpoint. As Blake, he got tied up next to a bomb that would explode in 24 hours unless Hyde defused it. However, when attempting to steal a Polaris submarine to roam the seas like a pirate, After Thor defeated Hyde, the authorities saw his brute strength and realized he must have impersonated Thor, but Thor forced himself to let him escape, as Jane thought Blake is still in danger.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1920, Spanknöbel was ordained as a minister on the Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement in Würzburg. He was admitted to the US as a minister in 1929, but his relationship with religion was dubious while he was in the country. Spanknöbel was a member of the Free Society of Teutonia and an employee of the Ford Motor Company. Initial support for American fascist organizations came from Germany. In May 1933, Nazi Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess gave Spanknöbel authority to form an American Nazi organization. Shortly thereafter, with help from the German consul in New York City, Spanknöbel formed the Friends of New Germany by merging two older organizations in the United States— the Society of American Friends of Germany (formed from the dissolved Gauleitung-USA or Gau-USA) and the Free Society of Teutonia; which were both small groups with only a few hundred members each. The Friends of New Germany was headquartered in Yorkville, Manhattan, but had a strong presence in Chicago.\n\nParagraph 7: Gearin was spotted by Canterbury-Bankstown CEO Peter Moore when he was playing for Christian Brothers Lewisham in the Commonwealth Bank Cup Schoolboys rugby league competition in 1974. He joined Canterbury-Bankstown in 1975. He made his first grade début for the Berries during the 1976 NSWRFL season in Canterbury's 23-20 win against the Newtown Jets at Belmore Sports Ground.  At the end of his first year of first grade his stat ended up playing 6 games, scoring 2 tries for 6 points. In 1977 he scored 5 tries in a Pre-Season trial match against the Queanbeyan Blues. His 1977 season was interrupted by injury. He became a regular first grader in 1978. Steve played in Canterbury's Heartbreaking 22-15 loss in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Qualifying Final against the Parramatta Eels. In 1979 he broke George Taylforth's 1967 goal kicking record of 204 points in the process. He played in Canterbury's 17 - 13 1979 NSWRFL season's Grand Final loss to the St. George Dragons where he scored 1 try and booted 2 goals. He scored 7 points on Grand Final day. In 1980 he was the New South Wales Rugby League's top point scorer.  He played in Canterbury's 18 - 4 1980 Grand Final victory over the Eastern Suburbs Roosters where he scored one of the greatest ever 1st grade Australian rugby league Grand Final tries in history in which he chased, caught and grounded a classic try off a Greg Brentnall bomb. He also booted 6 goals from 6 attempts. He scored 15 points on Grand Final day a Club Record. His 1980 stat ended up  playing 24 games, scoring 14 tries, booting 89 goals for 220 points. His 1981 and 1982 seasons were again interrupted by injury. In the 1981 season Gearin scored a Hat Trick 3 Tries against the Balmain Tigers at Leichhardt Oval.\n\nParagraph 8: On 1 September 2021, Stoilov took over the team of Levski Sofia for the second time in his career. He was appointed as a manager in one of the worst moments in the club's history, ranking 10th in the league standings after the first 6 games with 4 losses and just 2 wins and in a very bad financial state. A few days after his appointment he released three players – Simeon Slavchev, Valeri Bojinov and Hristofor Hubchev and signed two younger – José Córdoba from Etar and Dimitar Kostadinov from Septemvri Sofia. Under his management, the team managed to improve promptly, earning 20 points by the end of the half-season with 5 wins, 5 draws, and 3 losses and qualifying for the Bulgarian Cup quarter-finals, eliminating Marek Dupnitsa and Septemvri Simitli. The better results of the team were completely justified as Stoilov managed to dramatically improve the team's style of play, with Levski dominating in most of the games. Thus, at the time of the winter break, the team had climbed to 6th place in the league standings. In the upcoming transfer window, Stoilov released 6 players – Gjoko Zajkov, Christos Shelis, Ivaylo Naydenov, Borislav Tsonev, Georgi Aleksandrov and Martin Petkov, and signed just as many – defenders Kellian van der Kaap and Noah Sonko Sundberg, Bulgarians Iliyan Stefanov from Beroe and Filip Krastev (on loan from Belgian Lommel), both attacking midfielders. The other new additions were Brazilians Wenderson Tsunami (a left-back) and Welton (a forward). All of the newcomers became a key part of Stoilov's squad and were relatively young (all of them signed as free agents except Welton). In the second half of the season the team showed tremendous improvement winning 11 league games, drawing 2 and losing 2 finishing 4th in the final standings. In addition, Stoilov's Levski won the Cup, securing the first trophy for the team since 2009 and participation in European tournaments. In the quarter-finals, the team eliminated Septemvri Sofia with a 2–0 home win, and then faced Ludogorets in the semis, knocking them out with 4–2 aggregate score. The Cup final was against Levski's biggest rival – CSKA Sofia. Stoilov's team won 1–0, with the only goal scored by Iliyan Stefanov from long range. Throughout the whole tournament, Stoilov gave chance to the reserve goalkeeper of Levski – born in 2004 – Plamen Andreev, who started in each of the six matches, conceding only 2 goals (both in the first leg game against Ludogorets).\n\nParagraph 9:  Anne, eldest daughter (b. Ipswich 4 September 1630 – d.1707), m. John Ball (d.1686) of St. Paul Covent Garden, Esquire. Anne writes in her will that she wishes her body \"to be interred in the grave wherein my dear husband lyes buried in the church of S.t Dunstans in the East\", where she was buried on 5 September 1707. Her husband was buried there on 19 April 1686, and he writes in his will that his body is \"to bee interrd in the Church of S.t Dunstan in the East in the grave where my ffather and mother lye buried and this to bee performed in the evening\". He gives his \"deare and welbeloved\" wife Anne the same three thousand three hundred pounds that she has to dispose of in her testament, his coach and horses and also the lease of his house in Kingstreete Covent Garden which he held from the Earl of Bedford. He was probably a son or grandson of Richard Ball, son of John Ball of Wellingborow in Northampton, and his wife Anne Burnell (d.1664), the sister of William Burnell of Great Stanmore, Middlesex, gentleman, leatherseller of London, Thomas Burnell, whose wife was called Hester (d.1664), and Katherine Morley, the mother of John Morley of Charlestown and Anne Morley who married Thomas Gate. Richard and Anne had the children Richard and John Ball, Anne, married to James Young of London, merchant, Mary, wife of John Cooke, Barbara, wife of Thomas Reeve, Jane, wife of William Pindar, Margaret Allott, Elizabeth, wife of James Gough, a daughter married to William Robinson, the grandson Richard Cooke and the grandson Thomas Ball, probably son of daughter-in-law Susan. This Anne Ball also writes some fifty years prior on 13 March 1653 that she wishes to be buried in the parish church of St. Dunstans in the East, in London, near to the body of my late husband. The Ball family had a family grave in St. Dunstan-in-the-East where Richard Ball (d.1617), his wife (d.1654) and many of his children and grandchildren were buried. Anne Wren with her husband had the children John Ball and Anne Ball (d.1735). John Ball (d. 5 January 1732), of Hampton Court, Auditor to Prince George of Denmark, 2dW, married 1) his cousin Frances Watts (d.1704), the daughter of Edward Watts and Mary Wren, on 12 July 1700 at St. Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, City of London; 2) his cousin Alice Wright (1672 –  17 November 1724), the daughter of Sir Robert Wright and Susan Wren, on 8 April 1706 at St. Stephen Walbrok, City of London. He had four sons, John (b.1701), Edward (1702–1702), George (b.1703) and Francis (b.1704), by his first wife Frances. His will also mentions his grandchildren George and Anna Maria Ball.\n\nParagraph 10: Following HDZ's return to power in the 2003 general election, DC (which had been informally allied with HDZ during the election) gained a single seat in the Croatian Parliament and a single ministerial post in the Croatian Government. Vesna Škare-Ožbolt, the party's leader and their only representative elected to parliament, was appointed Justice Minister in the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I. She held the post from December 2003 to February 2006, when she was forced to step down by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader following allegations that she leaked information to the media, although some media pundits ascribed her resignation to her prominent public stance and ministerial results which overshadowed HDZ ministers. Since then, DC has been as an opposition party."}

The crystals range in size from 30 to 120 nanometers, which is optimal for their magnetotactic abilities. Smaller crystals are not as efficient and larger crystals can form magnetic domains in opposing directions. Some magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes (clusters of magnetotactic crystals) that deviate from the ideal chain-like arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may serve additional functions related to metabolism, although these functions are currently unknown.", "The text discusses the phenomenon of \"quilling,\" which is when a locomotive engineer uses the valve to control the flow of steam through a whistle, allowing them to play it like a musical instrument. The frequency of the whistle increases with blowing pressure, and an experiment showed that increasing steam pressure drove the whistle to a higher pitch. Pitch deviations in the whistle's frequency are likely caused by velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture. The text also mentions that frequency can vary with differences in temperature and blowing pressure. Industrial steam whistles are typically operated within a specific pressure range, and excessive pressure can cause the whistle to produce odd harmonics. The text also mentions that the length of the whistle affects the number and amplitude of harmonics produced. The harmonic profile of a whistle can also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset."], "answers": ["Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 10", "Paragraph 6"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Brockington was the ninth overall selection in the 1971 NFL Draft, after Jim Plunkett, Dan Pastorini, Archie Manning, and John Riggins, and ahead of Jack Tatum, Jack Youngblood, Jack Ham and Dan Dierdorf.

Don Antonio Crisafi and his brother Thomas, who had a  good military background, as he had become Knight of Malta in 1670, took part in a revolt against Spain in Sicily. The important city of Messina had at that time (1674–1678) about 100,000 inhabitants and was a dynamic port with a strategic position in the Mediterranean sea.  When the senate of Messina decided to revolt against Spain, the Crisafi brothers were among the military leaders organising the defence. In 1675, Messina obtained the military support of France which was in war against Spain, and the Crisafi brothers continued fighting under the orders of the Duke of Vivonne, the commander of  the French troops and a noble who was very close to King Louis XIV. Messina was able to resist against Spain and the French fleet was able to win some important naval battles against the combined fleet of Spain and Holland. But, in 1678, Louis XIV concluded the peace of Nimega and Messina was abandoned in the hands of the Spaniards.  Antoine and Thomas Crisafy, like a lot of nobles of Messina, had to flee to France, leaving their assets behind.  Since that time they changed their name in Crisafy, according to the French pronunciation. Probably thanks to their connection with the Duke of Vivonne, they were received in Versailles and obtained a little pension from the Sun King. They were eventually accused of a complot  against France and were imprisoned for a short time at La Bastille, in Paris, before being freed as they were found to be innocent. Then, in April 1684, Louis XIV decided to name them captains and each led a company of the seven that were sent to New France in that year. Despite their difficulty to adapt to the Canadian cold climate, they were among the most brave and capable officers in Canada as confirmed in several letters sent by the Governors of New France to Versailles. In Canada, the Crisafy brothers had the chance to meet Henry de Tonty, the officer of Italian origins whose name is linked to Cavelier de la Salle in the exploration of the Mississippi river and the land of the Indian Illinois. In 1686, they took part with governor de Denonville in the expedition against the Iroquois at Niagara. In 1692, Antoine was given charge of the troops at Sault-Saint-Louis and was able to fend off an attack by 800 Iroquois. In 1696, Thomas died, leaving a very good memory for his personal qualities. Very close to Governor de Calliere, Antoine Crisafy was  named king's lieutenant at Montreal in 1697 and, the following year, appointed Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. In 1699, he was named king's lieutenant at Quebec City. He married Marie-Claire, the daughter of François-Madeleine-Fortuné Ruette d'Auteuil de Monceaux in 1700. Following the death of François Provost, he became governor at Trois-Rivières. Crisafy died in office and was buried there on May 6, 1709. Neither Antoine nor Thomas had children and they did not become French citizens.\n\nParagraph 3: Meanwhile, Pablo and Fernando are confronted by the cat, but in their drunk state, decide to challenge the cat to a fist fight, telling him to \"put up your dukes!\" The cat chuckles, thinking the mice are crazy, or \"muy loco in la cabeza\", and prepares to eat them. Speedy soon arrives and sees this, and hits the cat on his foot with a mallet, forcing him to drop the drunk mice. Speedy rescues Pablo and hides him in a sardine tin, but when he goes back to get Fernando, it appears he is too late as the cat already ate him. However, when Speedy returns to the sardine tin, he's surprised to find both Pablo and Fernando there unharmed, and still drunkenly singing. When he tries to talk to them, in their inebriated state, they mistake Speedy for the cat, and Speedy takes Fernando home before coming back for Pablo. After Speedy leaves, however, Fernando climbs out of his house through the open front window, and staggers back to the alley to find Pablo. Speedy arrives just in time to see the cat devour Pablo, but quickly hits the cat on his foot, causing him to scream in pain, before Speedy sticks something in his mouth that causes him to expand from an explosion inside his body. Speedy, concerned that the audience did not see what he did, repeats the chain of events in slow motion: He hits the cat on his foot; as the cat screams, he rescues Pablo, but places him on a mousetrap, forcing Speedy to double back to save Pablo before the trap snaps. He then places Pablo in a jug, corking the lid, then goes back to plant a firecracker on the cat's outstretched tongue, lighting it before getting clear as the cat swallows the lit firecracker and it goes off inside him, leading to his dazed state with smoke coming out of his ears. Afterwards, Speedy goes back to the jug, but finds the bottom had been broken off, and Pablo nowhere to be seen. While Speedy goes to look for him, Fernando stumbles back into the alley and into the cat's mouth, mistaking it for cantina doors. When Speedy confronts him, the cat reveals Fernando on his tongue, who actually taunts the cat and snaps his fingers at him in defiance, before Speedy runs back and forth before hitting the cat on his foot again, leading to him opening his mouth to scream, and Speedy to rescue Fernando and plant another firecracker on the outstretched tongue, causing the cat to moan, \"Oh, no...\", before the firecracker explodes inside him again, and that gives the cat enough reason to give up and flee the city, finally had enough of Speedy.\n\nParagraph 4: Thevet and his colleagues land on the Brazilian mainland on November 10, and are welcomed and fed by a delegation of native people immediately upon their arrival. At the welcoming feast, they are served an alcoholic beverage brewed from a combination of different roots. Initially hoping to venture inland or elsewhere along the coast, the expeditionary team members are informed that there is little freshwater for a significant distance away from the indigenous settlement but that they would be welcome to remain near their landing site for the time being. Venturing to a nearby inlet, Thevet and company are impressed by an array of colorful birdsㅡtheir feathers making an attractive decoration for the sparse garments of native peopleㅡand a generous bounty of fish, upon which local residents may subsist. Finally Thevet describes some of the local flora, including beautiful trees unseen in Europe and small vines utilized by the natives as accessories and for medicinal purposes. Thevet describes a fruit which the  Tupinambá call the Hoyriri, now identified as the pineapple:,another fruit that commeth vp in the fieldes, which they name Hoyriri, the which to loke on, would be iudged to grow on some trée. Notwithstāding it groweth in a cer∣taine herbe that beareth leafe like to a Palme, as wel in the length as in largenesse, it groweth in the midst of the leaues very round, & within it be litle Nuts, of the which the kernell is white & good to eate, sauing that ouermuch therof, as wel as of other things, hurteth the braine. ... if... dressed & trimmed, it wold take away this vice. Notwith¦standing the Americanes eat therof, chiefly ye litle childrē. The fields ar very ful within two leagues of Cap de Fria.The Catholic author acknowledges and laments the absence of organized religion in the lives of indigenous people. Although they do believe in \"Toupan\"ㅡsome sort of higher being reigning above them and governing the climateㅡthey make no clear effort to worship or honor it as a collective. Moreover, rather than believe in a great prophet similar to those venerated in Abrahamic faiths, the natives passively celebrate \"Hetich,\" the figure allegedly responsible for teaching them to cultivate the roots that became an essential staple of their diet. Thevet then digresses from this point, describing some alternative properties of the roots that emerge once separate varieties are subjected to certain external forces. Following this, the author momentarily touches upon how Christopher Columbus and his team were initially worshiped by local Amerindians, before losing this divine status once it was gradually discovered that they behaved and functioned as ordinary men. Cannibalism is addressed at the end of this chapter, being attributed to certain indigenous groups who allegedly consume human flesh as one in European society might consume any other meat.\n\nParagraph 5: Stars with 40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger have non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards. When they exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star, the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core continues to fuse without interruption.  The star is considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior.  As the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium the convective effect separates the helium towards the core where it very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma. As this takes place the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward which increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from two to ten times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature. This causes the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger the potential circumstellar habitable zone where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system. The surface area of a sphere is found as 4πr2 so a sphere with a radius of  will release 400% as much energy at the surface and a sphere with a  will release 10000% as much energy.\n\nParagraph 6: Blowing pressure – Frequency increases with blowing pressure, which determines gas volume flow through the whistle, allowing a locomotive engineer to play a whistle like a musical instrument, using the valve to vary the flow of steam. The term for this was “quilling.” An experiment with a short plain whistle reported in 1883 showed that incrementally increasing steam pressure drove the whistle from E to D-flat, a 68 percent increase in frequency. Pitch deviations from the whistle natural frequency likely follow velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture, creating phase differences between driving frequency and natural frequency of the whistle. Although at normal blowing pressures the aperture constrains the jet to the speed of sound, once it exits the aperture and expands, velocity decay is a function of absolute pressure. Also, frequency may vary at a fixed blowing pressure with differences in temperature of steam or compressed air. Industrial steam whistles typically were operated in the range of 100 to 300 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (psig) (0.7 - 2.1 megapascals, MPa), although some were constructed for use on pressures as high as 600 psig (4.1 MPa). All of these pressures are within the choked flow regime, where mass flow scales with upstream absolute pressure and inversely with the square root of absolute temperature. This means that for dry saturated steam, a halving of absolute pressure results in almost a halving of flow. This has been confirmed by tests of whistle steam consumption at various pressures. Excessive pressure for a given whistle design will drive the whistle into an overblown mode, where the fundamental frequency will be replaced by an odd harmonic, that is a frequency that is an odd number multiple of the fundamental. Usually this is the third harmonic (second overtone frequency), but an example has been noted where a large whistle jumped to the fifteenth harmonic. A long narrow whistle such as that of the Liberty ship John W. Brown sounds a rich spectrum of overtones, but is not overblown. (In overblowing the \"amplitude of the pipe fundamental frequency falls to zero.\") Increasing whistle length increases the number and amplitude of harmonics, as has been demonstrated in experiments with a variable-pitch whistle. Whistles tested on steam  produce both even-numbered and odd-numbered harmonics. The harmonic profile of a whistle might also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset, as is the case for organ pipes.\n\nParagraph 7: Due to his opposition toward Milošević, Amfilohije for a short time found common ground with Milo Đukanović when in 1997 the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) became divided into pro- and anti-Milošević groups. Amfilohije gave blessings to Đukanović when he became Montenegrin president in January 1998. Over time, as Đukanović advocated for an independent Montenegro, a rift emerged in their relationship and Amfilohije became a strong critic of the Montenegrin president. Attempts to alleviate ecclesiastical tensions resulted in Đukanović and Prime Minister Igor Lukšić asking Amfilohije to become part of the MOC, a move that is unachievable as the MOC lacks recognition and is considered heretical by other Orthodox churches. In the late 1990s, Amfilohije, as head of the Montenegrin metropolitanate, was in charge of 160 clergy such as priests, monks and nuns that provided religious service to more than 90% of parishes and monasteries within Montenegro. In the mid-2000s, Amfilohije commented and made critical statements regarding the integration of Serbia into the European Union. Amfilohije opposed dialogue and was anti-ecumenical in relation to the Catholic Church. In the late 20th century, Amfilohije gave support to nationalists and radical anti-Westerners and in the early twenty first century he had devoted his efforts toward dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. During February 2003, Amfilohije was head of a SOC delegation that visited Vatican City and German Catholic media reported that he invited the Pope to Belgrade, later denied by the SOC. Exposed to Catholic influence, Amfilohije has shifted his position about the \"evil essence\" of people in the West and has begun to distinguish between a \"bad\" secular and \"good\" anti-secular Europe. Amfilohije has promoted and advocated for the concept of \"theo-democracy\" without going into the specifics of the idea as a possible opposition toward liberal democracy. Amfilohije's views remain distant from a liberal perspective and as such, Klaus Buchenau states, he cannot be labelled a \"pro-Westerner\". In 2005 Amfilohije urged Radovan Karadžić, who evaded capture from the ICTY indictment, to give himself up.\n\nParagraph 8: Crisis Aftermath: The Battle For Blüdhaven #1, introduces a character named Andy Franklin, a former scientist caught in the blast that destroyed Blüdhaven who had been held as an experiment in the secret internment camps within the shattered city. He is referred to in the story as \"some kind of human bomb\". With issue #2, he becomes the new Human Bomb, first displaying his powers in Blüdhaven #3 when he plucks off a piece of his fingernail, flicks it, and kills an oncoming troop of Atomic Knights in the resulting explosion. He is a lifelong fan of Green Lantern, even refusing to attack him during the Battle For Blüdhaven series. In Uncle Sam & the Freedom Fighters #2, Uncle Sam remarks that a drop of Franklin's sweat would be sufficient to level Manhattan. Andy is highly emotional, and is hurt deeply because his teammates refer to him as a freak because of his destructive powers. He has a higher sense of morality than his teammates, but has shown that he will use lethal force when he sees his friends hurt. Andy seems to be more powerful than his predecessors, as seen in Uncle Sam and The Freedom Fighters #2, when he created a concussive blast just by slamming his gloved fists together. Andy's condition requires him to take special medication developed by SHADE, otherwise he will involuntarily explode.\n\nParagraph 9: The 1943 Atlantic hurricane season marked the first deliberate reconnaissance aircraft flights into tropical cyclones. The season officially lasted from June 16 to October 31, which was, at the time, considered the most likely period for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of ten storms from 1943 are listed in the Atlantic hurricane database, and an eleventh system that affected Florida and Georgia has been identified as a probable tropical depression. The first system of the year, dubbed the \"Surprise hurricane\", caused severe damage throughout Texas and Louisiana in June, partially because information about its approach was censored in the fray of World War II; the storm caused 19 deaths and $17 million in damage. A major hurricane in mid-August produced hurricane-force winds in Bermuda, and several other tropical cyclones throughout the year resulted in strong winds there. In September, a hurricane impacted the western Gulf Coast of the United States, then a tropical storm struck the Mid-Atlantic. The two storms resulted in $419,000 and $20,000 in damage, respectively; one death was attributed to the latter system. In mid-October, a strong hurricane resulted in flooding and damage to crops throughout the Caribbean; after becoming post-tropical, it contributed to moderate impacts across Nova Scotia.\n\nParagraph 10: Magnetotactic crystals range anywhere in size from 30 nanometers to 120 nanometers. This size allows them to be magnetically stable and to help optimize the MTB ability toward magnetotaxis. The single domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. A smaller size would not be as efficient to contribute to the cellular magnetic moment, the smaller size crystals are superparamagnetic, therefore they are not continuously magnetic. Crystals exceeding 120 nanometers can form magnetic domains in opposition to the desired direction. While a single magnetosome chain could appear to be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. A reported example includes large magnetosomes (up to 200 nanometers) found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells contain enough magnetosomes that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but the magnetosomes are clustered on one side of the cell. In this arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the magnetosome chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may lead to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes; possibly related to metabolism."}

Meanwhile, the Baha Segulleh selected Awad Deriyeh, but he was also killed, leading them to choose Mattar, the son of Hirsi, as the next Sultan.

This painting stands in a long tradition of Dutch still life paintings depicting vanitas symbols.  These symbols include not only hourglasses, skulls and smoking candles but also attributes of scholarship and intellectual inquiry assembled in an amateur collector's cabinet or the study of a humanist scholar.  This tradition is also found in the Dutch painter Gerard Dou's rare still lifes, which are considered an important influence on van der Heyden's still lifes.  Dou's Allegorical Self-Portrait in a Studio, which includes still life elements, has been identified as an important influence on this composition.  In particular, like in Dou's composition, van der Heyden's still life scene depicts a wide range of objects of an artistic as well as a scientific nature.  These objects reference the passion of contemporary scholars for putting together collections of miscellaneous objects.  The objects in van der Heyden's Still Life with Globe, Books, Sculpture, and Other Objects were apparently selected to evoke the two intellectual attributes of the active and contemplative life.  The contemplative life is the life of art, philosophy and theology while the active life is characterised by curiosity about the outside world and, in particular, the commerce with the New World in which the home country of van der Heyden was actively involved.  This world of trade is represented in the globe and atlas, as well as the imported products such as the Chinese silk cloth on the table, the Japanese lacquered box and the exotic animal (a South American iguana) suspended at the back of the composition.  The map on which the atlas is open is a plan of the fortifications of Bergen-op-Zoom.   These fortifications had been built during the Eighty Years War with Spain and had played an important role in achieving the first victories against the Spanish troops.  They thus referenced the founding myths of the nation. Van der Heyden may also have selected this map as a reference to the recent hostilities with France.  The same map is also included in two of his later still lifes.   In the lower right of the painting is a large Protestant Bible opened to the end of Het Boeck der Psalmen (Book of Psalms) at the chapter entitled PROVERBIA / Spreuken / SALOMONIS (Solomon's Proverbs).  It is likely that the artist intended to reference the messages in Solomon's Proverbs about wisdom, self-discipline and justice as well as the vanitas message, as one of the Proverbs states that only righteousness can deliver from death.\n\nParagraph 4:  Deriyeh, the head of the Rer Segulleh, was universally proclaimed Sultan by the rest of the Habr Yunis tribe, and was really the first of the Habr Yunis Sultans, although his father, Segulleh, had tried to pose as such. Sultan Deriyeh lived to a great age, and had no less than eighteen sons, of whom the first two were borne to him by a woman of the Makahil section of the Habr Awal tribe, and the elder of these, Aman by name, joining with his brother, formed the Ba Maka-hil, while his remaining sixteen stepbrothers formed the Baha Deriyeh. Aman had ten sons, the eldest of whom was Ahmed, who died before his father, who himself died before his old father, the aged Sultan Deriyeh. Now, as soon as Sultan Deriyeh died there was trouble as to his successor. The Ba Makahil claimed that Ismail and Hirsi, of their section, were entitled to the honour ; but the Rer Segulleh and some of the Baha Deriyeh, said, \"No, as several of the late Sultan's sons are still living, one of them should be their Sultan before any of the grandsons\"; so they invited Awid Deriyeh to be their representative. In the meantime, Ismail was killed fighting with the Ogaden and Hirsi by the Baha Segulleh. The Ba Makahil now had to look for another successor, so they sent for Nur, the son of Ahmed Aman, and nephew to Ismail and Hirsi, who was living the life of a Mullah at Hahi, near Odweina. Nur, much against his will, consented to be their Sultan, although he preferred the life he was leading as a Mullah. For some years now there were two Sultans of the Habr Yunis, namely, Sultan Nur of the Habr Yunis, Ba Makahil, and Sultan Awd Deriyeh of the Baha Segulleh; so it will be seen the powerful section of the Baha Segulleh had gone to the Baha Deriyeh for their representative\". Awad Deriyeh was killed in a fight with the Ogaden Rer Ali, so the Baha Segulleh had to find another Sultan. Accordingly, they chose his brother Hirsi's son, Mattar; but this choice the Baha Deriyeh were not at all pleased with, so all the Habr Yunis tribe decided to meet and discuss the matter out and decide on one Sultan. After a great deal of discussion the two clans, Ba Makahil and Baha Deriyeh, who had claimants for the sultanate, decided to let them toss for it, the winner to be proclaimed Sultan, while the loser got one hundred camels as compensation from the winner. Sultan Nur won, and was proclaimed Sultan of the Habr Yunis tribe.\n\nParagraph 5: It was only in 1855 that the idea was raised of founding a school specifically for the education of sons of ministers like the Methodist Church in England had at Kingswood School in Bath. Funds were raised with significant amounts coming from the United States and England. The original site for the school was to be in Portadown but the location was changed, first of all to Dublin. Land was acquired in Dublin but proceedings stalled. Several prominent Belfast Methodists began a campaign to have the school built in Belfast. The Methodist Conference allotted the remaining £2000 left from the purchase of the Dublin site to Belfast so long as they could raise £8000 extra with the added proviso that no building could take place until they had raised £10,000. A last attempt was made 1863 for the building to take place in Portadown but this failed. The necessary money had been raised by 1864 to satisfy the Conference's stipulations but it was held that £10,000 would not be sufficient. Further fundraising missions were made to the United States and England in 1866. These were led by Robinson Scott, Robert Wallace and William McArthur. Wallace would die on this mission in Cincinnati from cholera. However an additional £10,000 was raised. Several subsequent missions took place to fund building work.\n\nParagraph 6: It is a tree reaching 30 meters in height. The young, gray to dark brown branches are sparsely hairy, but become hairless when mature. The branches have sparse lenticels. Its elliptical, slightly leathery to leathery leaves are 14–31.5 by 5-13 centimeters. The leaves have wedge-shaped to rounded bases and tapering tips, with the tapering portion 4-18 millimeters long. The leaves are hairless on their upper surfaces and sparsely hairy on their lower surfaces. The leaves have 10-20 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. Its sparsely to densely hairy petioles are 6-15 by 1.5-3.5 millimeters with a broad groove on their upper side. Its Inflorescences occur in clusters of 5–8 on branches, and are organized on indistinct peduncles. Each inflorescence has 1-2 flowers. Each flower is on a densely hairy pedicel that is 13-32 by 0.3-0.9 millimeters. The pedicels are organized on a rachis up to 5 millimeters long that have up to 2 bracts. The pedicels have a medial, very densely hairy bract that is 0.5-2 millimeters long. Its flowers are unisexual. Its flowers have 3 oval sepals, that are 1-2 by 1.5-3 millimeters and partially fused at their bases. The sepals are hairless on their upper surface, densely hairy on their lower surface, and hairy at their margins. Its 6 petals are arranged in two rows of 3. The cream-colored, oval to elliptical, outer petals are 2.5-4.5 by 2.5-5 millimeters with hairless upper surfaces and densely hairy lower surfaces. The light yellow to golden yellow, diamond-shaped inner petals have a 2-8 millimeter long claw at their base and a 3-11 by 2-5 millimeter blade. The inner petals have pointed bases and tips. The inner petals are slightly hairy on their upper surfaces, and very densely hairy on their lower surfaces. The inner petals have a solitary, butterfly-shaped, smooth, raised gland on their upper surfact. Male flowers have 30-42 stamens that are 0.5-0.9 by 0.6-1 millimeters. Female flowers have 8-9 carpels that are 1-2 by 2.5-3.5 millimeters.  Each carpel has 5-7 ovules arranged in two rows. The female flowers have 10-13 sterile stamens. The fruit occur in clusters of up to 5 on slightly hairy pedicles that are 10-35 by 1.5-4.5 millimeters. The brown, elliptical fruit are 18-46 by 10-31 millimeters. The fruit are wrinkly, and very densely hairy. Each fruit has 4-7 hemi-spherical to lens-shaped seeds that are 10–14.5 by 7-10 by 4-8 millimeters and are arranged in two rows.  The seeds are wrinkly.\n\nParagraph 7: The title was first assumed in 1340 by Edward III of England, the Kingdom of England being ruled by the Plantagenet dynasty at the time. Edward III claimed the throne of France after the death of his uncle Charles IV of France. At the time of Charles IV's death in 1328, Edward was his nearest male relative through Edward's mother Isabella of France.  Since the election of Hugh Capet in 987, the French crown had always passed based on male-line relations (father to son until 1316). There was no precedent for someone succeeding to the French throne based on his maternal ancestry, nor had there been a need to.  There had been no shortage of sons for more than three centuries from the inception of the House of Capet until the early 14th century, when new precedents concerning female inheritance finally had to be introduced.  On the death of Philip IV the Fair's son Louis X in 1316, immediately followed by that of his son John I the Posthumous, it had to be decided whether his young daughter Joan or his brother Philip would succeed to the throne. Philip arranged for his coronation, and became Philip V of France. He was challenged by the supporters of the Princess Joan, daughter of Louis X, on the basis of his right to the throne. In response, he convened an assembly of prelates, barons, and burgesses at Paris, who acknowledged him as their lawful king, and declared that \"Women do not succeed to the throne of France.\" This was later said to have been based on the 5th century Salic law, but it is now known that the Salic Law was only rediscovered later and used by the lawyers of the Valois kings to fortify their masters' title with an additional aura of authenticity.\n\nParagraph 8:  SH 46 was originally designated on October 20, 1919 as a route from New Braunfels north to Johnson City. On July 13, 1925, the route had been shortened, with the section north of Spring Branch transferred to SH 108.  This alignment of SH 46 only consisted of the portion from US 281 to US 81 in New Braunfels.  US 81 no longer exists today in favor of I-35 and is known as a business loop of I-35. On July 16, 1928, it extended to Seguin. On July 15, 1935, the section from New Braunfels to Seguin was cancelled. On October 26, 1967, the highway was relocated in New Braunfels to the east along the alignment of Loop 337, but still had an eastern terminus at US 81.  The original alignment in New Braunfels was redesignated as Loop 453, but to be signed as a business route of SH 46. On June 21, 1990, the designation of this segment was officially changed to Business 46.  On February 26, 1968, SH 46 was extended to the south from US 81 to I-35, replacing part of Farm to Market Road 25.  On September 28, 1988, the highway was extended at both ends, extending the eastern end south replacing Farm to Market Road 25 from I-35 to FM 78 and then replacing part of Spur 351 from FM 78 to I-10 in Seguin.  The western terminus was extended to the west replacing Ranch to Market Road 475 from US 281 to SH 16.  A portion of this route had been FM 1719 which had been combined with RM 475 in 1951. On May 14, 1990, the highway was extended to its current alignment when it was extended south from I-10 to SH 123 replacing the remainder of Spur 351.\n\nParagraph 9: The Sangam poems also give a detailed account of the day-to-day routine of the inhabitants of Madurai during this period: Long before dawn, musicians tuned their lutes and practiced upon them, pastry cooks cleaned the floors of their shops and toddy sellers opened their taverns for early customers. Minstrels went around singing their morning blessings. At sunrise, conch shells boomed and big drums resounded in temples, monasteries and the palace of the king. Flower-sellers and vendors of fragrant powders, arecanuts and betel leaves strolled the streets. Elderly women with tempting dainties and sweet smelling flowers went from door to door offering the articles for sale. The wealthy classes drove in chariots pulled by horses or rode on ambling steeds which were trained to special paces. In the great market, which was held in an extensive square, several articles were put up for sale such as garlands of flowers, fragrant pastes, coats with metallic belts, leather sandals, weapons, shields, carts, chariots and ornamented chariot steps. The garment shops sold clothing of various colors and patterns, made of cotton, silk or wool and were neatly arranged in rows. In the grain merchants' street, sacks of pepper and sixteen kinds of grains including paddy, millet, gram, peas and sesame seeds were heaped along the street. The jewellers, who conducted business from a separate street, sold precious articles such as diamonds, pearls, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, topaz, coral beads and varieties of gold. In the cool hours of the evening, the nobleman drove out on their chariots accompanied by attendants clad in red garments, who ran by the side of the chariots. The ladies appeared on the high terraces of their mansions, wearing ankle rings and golden bracelets with the fragrances from their perfumes spreading through the streets. The merchants of perishable articles move about the streets disposing of unsold merchandise. Hotels and restaurants are crowded with visitors who feast upon the meals served. A flourish of music from trumpets and other instruments summoned people to the evening worship, following which families proceededed to their places of worship to offer prayers. As the sun set, lamps were lit in each house. Youths, drunken soldiers and harlots decked with jewels and flowers started walking the streets. During festival season, processions of the deities were common, accompanied by dancing and loud music. By nightfall, petty traders closed up their shops and some of them went to sleep outside their stalls. Night guards started patrolling the streets, with bows and arrows, even during dark and rainy nights.\n\nParagraph 10: Over time, Taggart becomes more obsessed with gambling in Las Vegas, which lands him even more deeply in debt. He compounds his money and gambling problems by dealing with associated loan sharks, including the mean and dangerous L.A. bookmaker known as \"The Dutchman\" (Chad Everett). Taggart soon learns that even a L.A. pro football quarterback, whose football team he covers, is also on the Dutchman's payroll - as a means of cutting his own sports gambling debts. After clearing the story further with his sports editor (John Saxon), Taggart journeys to Las Vegas for a field report on his gambling series; he meets a newspaper publisher, who helps him make more gambling industry contacts. Through the MGM casino executive, Mr. Sweeney Keith Hefner, Taggart meets a sexy casino cocktail hostess named Flo (Catherine Hicks). Flo is sent to Taggart's hotel room for a night, but Taggart, loving the gaming tables, with Flo as his 'lucky charm', goes gambling at the Dunes Hotel casino. Taggart gambles with Flo at roulette, and wins. Taggart, as part of his on going news story, also checks out assorted Las Vegas bookmakers, including Leroy's. Taggart meets various Vegas gambling and business figures, including famed Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun, for more insights into the Las Vegas gambling world. He is unaware that the Dutchman's tough guy enforcer, \"Panama Hat\" (William Smith), is following him, until \"The Hat\" confronts him at the hotel pool, as Taggart attempts to relax on a chaise longue. Panama Hat forcefully orders Taggart to return to Los Angeles immediately, and settle up with the Dutchman, or there will be dire consequences."}

Later he meets a gorgeous woman at the Hotel Central during a dinner organized by João da Ega (his friend and accomplice from University who lives with Carlos) in honor of Baron Cohen, the director of the National Bank. After many comical and disastrous adventures he finally discovers the woman's name – Maria Eduarda, and ends up meeting her. The two fall in love and have dozens of nights together, drinking and having sex. However, the two start seeing each other in secret after an incident where a redneck-like man named Dâmaso, Carlo's ex-friend and rival, writes an article in a newspaper, accusing, humiliating, making fun of and revealing the past of Carlos and Maria. Eventually Carlos finds out that Maria lied to him about her past and he starts fearing the worst. Mr. Guimarães, a good friend of Maria's mother and an uncle-like figure to her, talks to Ega and gives him a box meant to be given \"to your friend Carlos... or to his sister!\". Ega does not understand this statement, because Carlos supposedly never had a sister. Ega is horrified and in a state of shock when he realizes that Maria is Carlos's sister. Ega, in despair, tells everything to Vilaça (the Maia family attorney) who informs Carlos about the incest. Carlos informs his dying grandfather, and Afonso is shocked by this news. However, Carlos cannot forget his love and does not say anything to Maria. Afonso dies because of apoplexy. At last, Carlos informs his newfound sister that they are siblings and that they cannot live like this anymore. Maria says one last goodbye to her former lover and to her friends before going away to an unknown future. Carlos, to forget his tragedies, goes on a trip around the world.\n\nParagraph 2: Ellis Park Stadium (known as Emirates Airline Park for sponsorship reasons) is a rugby union and association football stadium in the city of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa. It hosted the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which was won by the country's national team, the Springboks. The stadium was the country's most modern when it was upgraded in 1982 to accommodate almost 60,000 people. Today, the stadium hosts both football and rugby and is also used as a venue for other large events, such as open-air concerts. It has become synonymous with rugby as the only time when rugby was not played at Ellis Park was during 1980 and 1981, when the stadium was under construction during the upgrade.\n\nParagraph 3: The hamlet of Port Republic, Virginia, lies on a neck of land between the North and South Rivers, which conjoin to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. On June 6–7, 1862, Jackson's army, numbering about 16,000, bivouacked north of Port Republic, Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division along the banks of Mill Creek near Goods Mill, and Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's division on the north bank of North River near the bridge. The 15th Alabama Infantry regiment was left to block the roads at Union Church. Jackson's headquarters were in Madison Hall at Port Republic. The army trains were parked nearby.\n\nParagraph 4: Before being upgraded to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR 905 directly connected with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When Caltrans opened that segment of the SR 905 freeway in 2010, they omitted the interchange with SR 125, forcing traffic on SR 905 and SR 125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which SR 905 followed at that time) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, a direct freeway-to-freeway interchange was planned, which also included the new SR 11 freeway once it was to be constructed, with construction beginning in late 2015. SR 11 is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 905 eastbound to SR 125 northbound, SR 905 westbound to SR 125 northbound, and SR 11 westbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at the cost of over $21 million. Prior to December 16, 2021, traffic on southbound SR 125 was forced to exit onto Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's then southern terminus in order to connect to SR 11 and SR 905. Construction on the ramps for these connections began in 2018, with the ramps from SR 125 southbound to SR 11 eastbound and SR 125 southbound to SR 905 eastbound being completed on December 16, 2021, at the cost of $74 million. The ramp from SR 125 southbound to SR 905 westbound, which was still under construction at the time, was initially scheduled to open to traffic in 2023, but was instead opened to traffic on July 26, 2022, finally completing the interchange. There are no plans to construct the remaining connections from SR 905 westbound to SR 11 eastbound and SR 11 westbound to SR 905 eastbound.\n\nParagraph 5: A door closer is defined as any mechanical device that closes a door in a controlled manner, preventing it from slamming, in general after someone opens it, or after it was automatically opened. The force used to open the door is stored in some type of spring and when released this energy is then used to return the door to a closed position. Door closers can be linked to a building's fire alarm system.  Where doors need to be held open for the majority of the time they are held back with an electromagnetic device. When the fire alarm is triggered it cuts power to the electromagnetic hold-open device allowing the doors to close. These hold-open devices can be separate from the door closer or part of its design.\n\nParagraph 6: Although Baruch was met with continual resistance, by 1895, he successfully persuaded the State Legislature to pass a law to obligate cities exceeding a population of 50,000 to establish and maintain free bathhouse facilities, and an order from the local Board of Alderman to construct a public bath in the City of New York. In 1897, 9 Centre Market Place People's Baths, located between Centre and Mulberry Streets, served as a prototype public bathhouse. Financed by private contributions from the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP), and built on land owned by the City Mission and the Tract Society, the facility provided more than 100,000 people a year with a bath, soap, and a towel for five cents. In 1901, Baruch and his colleagues, Deputy Commissioner of Health of the City of New York Fowler and Dr. Van Santvoord, presided over the opening of the first free public bathhouse, Rivington Street municipal bath, located at 326 Rivington, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The bathhouse facility featured indoor and outdoor bathing pools, 45 showers and five soaking tubs for men, and 22 showers for women. Other public baths of the period, credited to the advocacy of Baruch, include the Clarkson Street Bathhouse, located at 83 Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, which provided showers, tubs, and a gymnasium complex on two floors, as well as an open-air classroom on the rooftop for children in poor health. The facility has since become part of the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center. In 1904, several more free public baths opened in Manhattan, including the Milbank Memorial Bath, located on 325–327 East 38th Street, a gift to the City of New York by a Borden (company) heiress, which had the capacity to hold 3,000 people. That same year, the City opened  West 60th Street Bathhouse, now Gertrude Elderle Recreation Center, providing 49 showers for men and 20 for women. In 1905, The Public Baths, designed by prominent architect Arnold W. Brunner, opened at 538 East 11th Street, between Avenues A and B, in the Alphabet City area of the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan; the building is also on the List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street. Asser Levy Public Baths opened in 1906, at the corner of Asser Levy Place and East 23rd Street, in the Kips Bay area. Also designed by architect Arnold W. Brunner and Martin Aiken, the facility has since become part of the Asser Levy Recreation Center, and the building is a designated historic landmark.\n\nParagraph 7: Examples of diseases of affluence include mostly chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other physical health conditions for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be an important risk factor — such as type 2 diabetes, asthma, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, hypertension, cancer, alcoholism, gout, and some types of allergy. They may also be considered to include depression and other mental health conditions associated with increased social isolation and lower levels of psychological well-being observed in many developed countries. Many of these conditions are interrelated, for example obesity is thought to be a partial cause of many other illnesses.\n\nParagraph 8: Lou Peters played youth football for Bristol City. Peters signed as a professional for Bristol City in March 1961. Manager Fred Ford gave Peters his league debut at outside right in the final Third Division match in 1960–61 in a 3–0 win v Brentford on 29 April 1961. Jimmy Rogers was the regular outside right as City rose to 6th place in 1961–62. Peters started the season at outside left but had to share the left wing duties with Jantzen Derrick and made only 13 appearances scoring his first goal in the final game of the season on 28 April 1962 in a 2–2 draw v Crystal Palace. Peters had a mid season spell in the side the following season, firstly on the right wing in place of Alex Tait and then on the left wing in place of Derrick. Peters made 19 appearances scoring three goals as the \"Robins\" slipped to 14th place in the table in 1962–63. In 1963-64 Bristol City recovered to 5th place in the Third Division but Peters failed to make the first team with Derrick playing outside right and new signing Peter Hooper the regular on the left wing. Peters returned to the left wing at the start of the following season making 40 appearances scoring six goals including 2 goals in the 3–0 win v Port Vale on 27 February 1965. This was the promotion season as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division. Peters started the Second Division campaign in the outside right position with Hooper on the left wing but switched to the left wing when Derrick replaced Hooper in October. In 1965-66 Bristol City finished 5th in the Second Division and Peters made 35 appearances scoring six goals. Bristol City struggled against relegation for much of 1966–67. The emergence of Danny Bartley on the left wing at the start of the season restricted Peters and Derrick to sharing the outside right position but at Christmas Peters reclaimed the outside left position with City lying 19th and retained the no.11 shirt for the rest of the season as City finished clear of relegation in 15th place. Peters made 28 appearances and was top scorer with nine goals in 1966-67 including a run of 7 goals in the final 12 league games. Peters also netted two goals against Halifax Town in the FA Cup as City reached the 5th round before losing 0–2 at Tottenham Hotspur. The following season saw Bristol City stave off relegation after a season long struggle finishing in 19th place. Peters had several spells in the first team making 22 appearances without scoring on the left wing sharing duties with Bartley in 1967–68. Peters also played in 3 FA Cup ties as City reached the 5th round again before losing 0–2 at Leeds United.\n\nParagraph 9: Settlement in the area was particularly concentrated within a radius of  of the intersection of Eleventh Road and Wungong Road (Wungong Road being known as 'Rowley Road' at that time), an intersection that came to be known as 'Bodicoat's Corner' after the couple who occupied the cottage on the north side of the intersection. Names of other early families included Cockshott, Hilbert, Sermon, Marsh, Billingham, Whiteley, Cassell, Dutton, Smith, Aitkin, Mills, Baggs, Grafham, Henderson and Wheeler.  These settlers formed a community and took the initiative to erect a hall on Eleventh Road,  north of Bodicoat's Corner (at the intersection with Rowley Road). The land was donated by Dutton. It was vested in the Congregational Union of Australia and formally known as the 'Wongong Congregational Mission Hall'. This hall was the centre of community activities for the next 50 years. In the early 1950s, while for a time disused by the Congregationalists, it was hired by the fledgling Free Reformed Church for their worship services, Bible study evenings and, in 1954, as the venue for the first synod of the Free Reformed Churches of Australia.  Over the years, the hall served as a venue for various religious and secular festivities (but not dancing), weddings, a meeting venue for the local Progress Association, a polling place for elections, and even for a short time as an overflow classroom for the Armadale Senior High School. By the early 1960s, the hall had fallen into disuse and in 1963 it was dismantled and relocated to Roleystone. A concrete pad and steps remained on the site until around 2013 when the steps were relocated to the grounds of the newly opened Free Reformed Church of Darling Downs, on the corner of Rowley Road and Masters Road. The site continues to have social significance to many local residents.\n\nParagraph 10: Orange Reservoir is a reservoir located in the reservation's northern tract. Within the borders of West Orange, it is owned by the City of Orange and operated and maintained under contract with United Water. It was originally developed during the intense urbanization of northeastern New Jersey in the late 19th century, drawing from the Rahway River. The man-made lake is no longer part of the water-supply system and since the late 2000s (decade) various proposals have been made to allow its use as a recreational resource as part of the Recreational Complex. The complex abutting the reservoir includes a miniature golf course, and a boathouse-restaurant opened in 2011.  Proposals were complicated by the fact that while owned by one municipality, it lies within the borders of another, and it is unclear whether it is taxable. Offers by the Essex County Park System to buy or lease property were put in place as a possible resolution. The county was able to reach an agreement to lease the reservoir from the City of Orange until 2032. In November 2013 it was announced that bridges and other improvements for recreational use would be made."}

Reviewers commended her technique, breath control, and ability to play difficult passages without taking breath. The saxophone itself was described as a novelty instrument with a unique sound that resembled a mixture of clarinet, saxhorn, and bassoon. Despite the positive reviews, Linden's gender was often mentioned as a surprising factor due to the rarity of female wind players. The text also mentions another female musician, cornetist Anna Theresa Berger, who was comparable to Linden in skill and received similar reviews.

However, after Derek's death, Owen goes to the army. He later returns, and she grieves her brother's loss with him. The twelfth season sees Amelia and Owen's romance developing further, as Amelia expresses repressed anger over Meredith unplugging Derek before she could say goodbye. She is also angry over Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) hiring Penny Blake (Samantha Sloyan), one of Derek's doctors on the day he died. Later, she marries Owen but expresses doubt and second thoughts before the wedding in the season 12 finale. The thirteenth season sees Amelia and Owen's marriage face problems when the idea of pregnancy brings repressed memories of the death of her firstborn son, Christopher. They divorce early in the fourteenth season civilly, after Amelia's brain tumor is removed, explaining some of her erratic behavior late in the thirteenth season. Late in the fourteenth season sees Amelia helps a teenage addict named Betty and her six-month son, Leo. Owen eventually adopts Leo, and Betty returns home to her parents for stability. Despite Owen and Amelia rekindling romantic feelings, Owen discovers former flame Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) is pregnant with his baby. Amelia starts sleeping with Link and later discovers she is pregnant with his child. She expresses uncertainty about revealing the paternity of the baby, as it might have been Owen's, but Link's affirmation of loving the child regardless of whether he is the father soothes her. She gives birth to their son in the sixteenth-season finale, who was later named Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln in the season premiere of season 17. At the end of Season 17, Link proposes to Amelia, but she turns him down. In season 18, Amelia was part of a storyline with Meredith which saw them travel to Minnesota to take part in Parkinson’s Disease research with the hope of curing the disease. Whilst in Minnesota, Amelia met a fellow Hopkins Alumni, Neuroscientist Dr. Kai Bartley who identifies as non-binary.

Amelia guide meditates Kai outside Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital as David is having surgery and the pair finally share a kiss.\n\nParagraph 3: Meyer moved to Boulder, Colorado because he \"just wanted to get as far from the New York environment as [he] could.\" There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time \"skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado.\" He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he \"tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh.\" He claimed that \"[he] didn't know what [he] was doing,\" and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: \"I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine.\" Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stone'''s \"Hot List\" in 1989. Meyer noted: \"The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that.\" Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: \"In comedy circles, [Army Man has] taken on almost mythological proportions.\" This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt \"embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined.\"\n\nParagraph 4: When Habbus died in 1038, Samuel ibn Naghrillah made certain that King Habbus’ second son Badis ibn Habus succeeded him, not his first born son Bulukkin. The reason behind this act was that Badis was more favored by the people, compared to Bulukkin, with the general Jewish population under Samuel ibn Naghrillah supporting Badis. In return for his support, Badis made Samuel ibn Naghrillah his vizier and top general. Some sources say that he held office as a viziership of state for over three decades until his death sometime around or after 1056. Because Jews were not permitted to hold public office in Islamic nations as an agreement made in the Pact of Umar, that Samuel ibn Naghrillah, a Jew or dhimmi, should hold such a high public office was rare. His example was used to support the Golden Age theory, regarding Jewish life under Muslim rule, rather than the lachrymose view. His unique position as the viziership made him the highest ranking Jewish courtier in all of Spain. Recognizing this, in the year of 1027, he took on the title of nagid, or Prince. The peculiar fact regarding his position as the top general in the Granada army was that he was a Jew. That a Jew would command the Muslim army, which he did for 17 years, having them under his authority, was an astonishing feat. Other leading Jews, including Joseph ibn Migash, in the generation that succeeded Samuel ha-Nagid, lent their support to Bulukkin and were forced to flee for their safety.\n\nParagraph 5: Usingen (Latin Osinga), which in Frankish times likely existed as a fortified stopping place at an old crossroads, was first mentioned in the Codex Eberhardi, a manuscript from the Fulda monastery, and it is generally accepted that references made to the town go back to between 754 and 802. Archaeological proof of a settlement on the modern town's site back in Carolingian times has yet to be unearthed, although, not far from town, the remains of a Carolingian courtyard were once dug up. The possibility therefore exists that today's Usingen might not lie on the same spot as it once did, having relocated at some time in the past. More investigation will be needed before this is ascertained.\n\nParagraph 6: However, the 2003 season (and Little's entire tenure with the Red Sox) is mostly remembered for his controversial decision during Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Red Sox led the game 5–2 in the 8th inning, and were five outs away from reaching the World Series. Little visited the mound after starting pitcher Pedro Martínez gave up three straight hits, and a run from Derek Jeter, but he decided against taking out the ace pitcher, who had thrown 118 pitches to that point. The Yankees tied the game the next at-bat when Jorge Posada hit a two-run bloop single, and went on to win the game (and the pennant) in the 11th inning off of a home run by Aaron Boone.\n\nParagraph 7: When the Trane Company moved its factory into the area in the 1960s, the area exploded in growth, both residentially and commercially. During the 1980s, St. Bethlehem faced possible annexation to Clarksville, though the vote on the annexation barely passed. In recent years, the St. Bethlehem post office has become a branch of the Clarksville post office and St. Bethlehem has ceased to exist as an address.  November 2004 had the opening of the Gateway-Vanderbilt Cancer Treatment Center just off U.S. 79, and in June 2008, the new Gateway Medical Center opened south of U.S. 79, next to the newly constructed Governor's Square Loop.\n\nParagraph 8: In the meantime, Corporal Stefan York and his section had been patiently manning their hiding place on the western end of Navy Point. As Argentine landing craft were reported approaching Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired a Carl Gustav anti-tank round which the British, in an interview with military historian Martin Middlebrook, claimed to have penetrated the side of an Argentine Marine Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, killing all on board. According to Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Jorge Santillán, an Amtrack Amphibious Recovery Vehicle around this time had entered Stanley Harbour after the capture of Government House, to carry out emergency repairs on the two amphibious armoured personnel carriers that had been damaged in the earlier gun-battle near the Ionospheric Research Station.Local fireman Neville Bennett kept a dairy of the Argentine occupation and would report seeing one amphibious personnel carrier in difficulty after losing one of its tracks, \"Some of the APCs were to be seen moving down the other side of the harbour. One appeared to be in difficulty, I think it had shed a track. One of the helicopters goes over to look at it, all fixed and they move off again towards the naval fuel depot with its tanks and diesel and other stores.\"\n\nParagraph 9: Another review in the Courier praised her technique and breath control:Miss Louise Linden, the remarkable performer upon the saxophone . . . is said to be superior as any performer in the country. Her powers of execution are marvellous and she can play a long and difficult passage, that ordinarily requires from two to three inspirations, without removing the instrument from her lips or taking breath.Due to the rarity of female wind players and the newness of the saxophone, both Linden and her instrument were promoted—and responded to—as novelties. Reviewers often attempted to describe the sound of the saxophone to readers who presumably had never heard the instrument:The most pleasing part of the programme at this resort during the past week was the Saxophone solos by Miss Louise Linden. This instrument is but little known, but in the hands of such an artist is capable of some most charming effects. Its tones are a mixture of clarionette, saxhorn and bassoon, susceptible of great modulations and flexibility of sound, and resembling somewhat the human voice.Cornetist Anna Theresa Berger (1853–1925) was actually Linden's closest peer as a musician. Each equaled prominent male soloists on her respective instrument in both technique and expression. Although Linden and Berger both received exceedingly positive reviews, these were often tempered by disclaimers taking into account their gender. Linden's 1881 performance of The Carnival of Venice at the Summer-Garden Concerts at the Academy of Music in Baltimore, createdmuch interest by her superior execution on the instrument. She played in response \"Old Folks at Home\" very sweetly. Later in the evening she played \"Home, Sweet Home.\" The audience were entertained not only with the music but with the novelty. It is an exceptional thing for men to play solos on the saxophone, let alone a woman.\"A reviewer from the Rochester, New York, Union & Advertiser pronounced astonishment that a woman could display such capability on a wind instrument:By far the most remarkable performance of the evening, however, was Miss Louise Linden's playing upon the saxophone. This instrument, a comparatively modern invention, requires not only great endurance in a player, but also the utmost facility of manipulation. These difficulties were most brilliantly surmounted by the young lady. It must have required no slight amount of courage for a woman to undertake so unusual a task as the learning of a wind instrument, and no slight amount of perseverance to overcome the many obstacles that such a task would naturally present. The artistic finish with which Miss Linden acquitted herself last night merits unstinted praise and admiration.\n\nParagraph 10: The same year Josel heard that the Hessian Jews had to suffer many persecutions because of a pamphlet by Bucer. He therefore wrote a defense of Judaism in Hebrew, to be read in synagogue every Sabbath for the comfort of his coreligionists. The magistrate of Strasbourg having expressed the belief that attacks on Christianity were contained in the defense, Josel had a verbatim translation made and sent to him. Soon Josel had to defend the Jews against the attacks of Luther himself, who in 1543 had published a very spiteful pamphlet, titled Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies), which had led to harsh treatment of Jews in various Protestant districts. Josel refuted Luther's assertions in a voluminous petition to the magistrate of Strasbourg, and the latter thereupon inhibited a new edition of Luther's book. In 1541 Josel appeared as \"chief of the Jews in the German lands\" at the Reichstag of Regensburg, and succeeded in averting a dangerous edict which would have forbidden the Jews to engage in any monetary transaction. He succeeded at the Reichstag of Speyer in 1544 in obtaining a new letter of protection for the German Jews from the emperor, wherein they were expressly allowed to charge a much higher rate of interest than the Christians, on the ground that they had to pay much higher taxes than the latter, though all handicrafts and the cultivation of land were prohibited to them. At the same time Josel paid to the emperor in the name of the German Jews a contribution of 3,000 florins toward the expenses of the French war (the French having at this time allied with the Turks). In the Speyer letter of protection, referred to above, the emperor disapproved of the accusation of ritual murder, and he ordained that no Jew should be put in prison or sentenced for this crime without sufficient proof. Josel was anxious to obtain this order because in 1543 at Würzburg five Jews accused of ritual murder had been imprisoned and tortured. After having personally interceded in favor of these prisoners Josel at length obtained their pardon from the emperor."}

He managed to capture the Atom and lock him inside a watch, but the Atom escaped and tricked Chronos into thinking he was wrong. Chronos later escaped from jail by using a guard's watch. He continuously attempted to steal valuable items using his time-manipulating abilities, but the Atom always thwarted his plans.

One of Seithenyn's officials, Teithrin ap Tathral, discovers that the embankment is in a poor state of repair, and tells Elphin, son of king Gwythno.  Together they find Seithenyn, who is as usual drunk, and warn him of the dangerous state of the sea-defences, but he dismisses their fears with specious arguments.  Elphin then meets Angharad, Seithenyn's beautiful daughter, and together they watch the onset of a mighty tempest, which destroys the embankment so that the sea breaks through.  Seithenyn, with drunken bravado, leaps into the waves, sword in hand, but Teithrin, Elphin and Angharad make their escape to king Gwythno's castle.  Gwythno is distraught at the submersion of the best part of his kingdom under Cardigan Bay.  Elphin marries Angharad and settles down to earn his living from the produce of a salmon-weir he has constructed.  One day he finds in this weir a coracle containing a baby, whom he names Taliesin and raises along with his own daughter, Melanghel.  As Taliesin grows up he learns the precepts of Druidism and becomes a bard.  Gwythno dies, and Elphin inherits the throne of the reduced and impoverished kingdom of Caredigion, but is soon abducted by Maelgon, king of Gwyneth.  Maelgon's son, Rhun, visits Elphin's home and seduces a woman whom he believes to be Angharad, but who is actually her servant.  Taliesin sets out to free Elphin at the prompting of his foster-sister, Melanghel, with whom he is in love.  At Maelgon's court he announces himself as a bard of Elphin, vindicates Angharad's honour, and enters into a poetic contest with Maelgon's bards, in the course of which he warns him of various impending dooms, including an attack by King Arthur and death by plague.  Taliesin returns to Caredigion.  Rhun follows him, wanting to make a second attempt on Angharad, but he is lured into a cave and there imprisoned when a boulder is released to seal up the entrance.  Taliesin sets out to find King Arthur in Caer Lleon.  On his way there he stops at Dinas Vawr, a fortress just captured by king Melvas, whose men are celebrating their victory in wine and song; among them he is astounded to find Angharad's father, Seithenyn ap Seithyn, who it turns out survived the flooding of Gwaelod so many years before.  Taliesin reaches Caer Lleon, admires its splendours, then gets audience of King Arthur, who is keeping Christmas merrily, even though his wife Gwenyvar has been abducted by person or persons unknown.  He tells the king a secret he has learned from Seithenyn, that Gwenyvar is being held by Melvas; then he moves on to Avallon, where Gwenyvar is being kept captive, in the hope of negotiating her peaceful release.  There he meets Seithenyn again, together with the abbot of Avallon, both of whom agree to help him.  Together these three convince Melvas that he has more to gain by voluntarily releasing Gwenyvar to Arthur than by facing Arthur's wrath.  Back in Caer Lleon Taliesin takes part in another bardic contest.  Llywarch sings his \"The Brilliancies of Winter\", Merlin his \"Apple Trees\" and Aneirin his \"The Massacre of the Britons\", but Taliesin's contribution, a portion of the Hanes Taliesin, is declared the finest.  Seithenyn and the abbot then make their entrance, bringing Gwenyvar with them, and having restored her to Arthur they tell him that Taliesin was instrumental in securing her release.  The grateful king grants Taliesin a boon, and Taliesin begs that Arthur will command Maelgon to release Elphin.  Maelgon himself makes his appearance at this point and unwillingly submits to Arthur's will.  Arthur sends an emissary to fetch Elphin, Rhun, and all other concerned parties, including Melanghel.  The story ends with Taliesin's marriage to Melanghel, and election as Chief of the Bards of Britain.\n\nParagraph 2: IPAP has organized and supported several international conferences on psychopharmacology algorithms. It has also supported the creation of several algorithms based on expert opinion. It is now in the process of creating \"evidence-based algorithms,\" that is algorithms created by experts and annotated with the evidence that leads to these algorithms. A schizophrenia algorithm has been created and one on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was released in July 2005. A general anxiety disorder (GAD) algorithm was released in 2006. Periodic updates of the algorithms are released as the basis of evidence changes. In addition, the algorithms are being translated into various non-English languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai) as the availability of translators permits.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1982, the Conservative Government led by Margaret Thatcher privatised these services, making shares in the newly formed National Freight Corporation available to employees at a price that proved to undervalue the company when they were floated on the stock market. Two businesses, National Carriers and Roadline, subsequently merged and operated briefly under the name National Carriers Roadline before becoming Lynx Express Delivery Network. This remained the company's full title, although it was shortened in practice. Following a reorganisation, rationalisation of core business interests and rebranding exercise, National Freight Corporation, by this time shortened to NFC plc, merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel, and Lynx Express was seen as outside its main area of concentration.\n\nParagraph 4: Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate, January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey) is an American singer and songwriter. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Paraders list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for \"Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal\". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.\n\nParagraph 5: Stars with 40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger have non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards. When they exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star, the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core continues to fuse without interruption.  The star is considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior.  As the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium the convective effect separates the helium towards the core where it very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma. As this takes place the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward which increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from two to ten times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature. This causes the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger the potential circumstellar habitable zone where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system. The surface area of a sphere is found as 4πr2 so a sphere with a radius of  will release 400% as much energy at the surface and a sphere with a  will release 10000% as much energy.\n\nParagraph 6: The original vision for Shingwauk Hall in the early 19th century came from  Chief Shingwauk, the chief of the Garden River Ojibway people, as he felt \"that the future Ojibway needed to learn the white man's academic method of education in order to survive in what was becoming a 'predominately non-native world with non-native values'\". While Chief Shingwauk's vision of a teaching wigwam for his people would not come to fruition in his lifetime, a residential school would eventually receive funding in 1872 from the combined efforts of Chiefs Augustin Shingwauk and Buhkwujjenene Shingwauk (Chief Shingwauk's sons) and the Anglican Missionary, Rev. Edward Francis Wilson.\n\nParagraph 7: Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom when he tried to steal an atomic clock because of an idea ironically given to him by Ray Palmer. He came close to deducing the Atom's secret identity when he realized the Atom attacked him soon after Ray saw him, and succeeded in capturing the Atom and placing him inside a watch. The Atom escaped the watch while Chronos was breaking into a vault, and used a trick to make him think he was wrong. However he escaped from jail by adapting a guard's watch, making the ticks so loud they broke open his cell door. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks which each had a gem hidden inside, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos' plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos' weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions—lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time, an hourglass of concentrated time that could speed points up briefly and even make bricks next to a bank vault crumble in a few seconds, and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggests that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. Another story, published in World's Finest Comics #321 (1985), suggests that Chronos made the transition from a mere thief with a time gimmick to a full-fledged time traveler after becoming acquainted with the mysterious Dr. Fox, a criminal scientist who had never been apprehended and who was described by Chronos as \"the greatest mind since Einstein\". Pre-Crisis Chronos was a member of the Crime Champions, a trio of Earth-1 villains who teamed up with a trio of Earth-2 villains to commit robberies, then escape to the other world using a vibratory device the Fiddler accidentally discovered. Chronos is able to escape Wonder Woman, Batman and Green Lantern after stealing a million dollars from the Powers City Bank. When the Earth-2 Crime Champions impersonate the Earth-1 Crime Champions, the Icicle impersonates Chronos with the help of the Wizard's Tibetan magic, and fought Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, making them touch rubber, animal, and glass as part of a spell to trap the JLA. On Earth-2 Chronos tries to steal a rare clock from a lighthouse, and uses his vibratory watch to put Aquaman into a coma, but Superman is able to revive Aquaman and captures Chronos, crushing his watch. The JLA and JSA are captured again and magically placed in cages in space, but with the aid of the Green Lanterns escape and return to Earth. Chronos tries to help the Fiddler find an Earth-3 with his chronological knowledge, but is defeated by the Martian Manhunter and Black Canary.\n\nParagraph 8: In the final book of the series, Dar'khan flies Anveena over to the ruins of Quel'thalas (the elven homeland), and the four heroes try to stop him. A band of exiled elves led by Lor'themar, a former ranger-captain, try to reclaim Quel'thalas by ambushing lone groups of undead. Meanwhile, Kalecgos, Tyrygosa, Jorad Mace and their juvenile dragon Raac are trying to find out what is going on. Along the way, they are ambushed by a felhound, a large, vicious, magic-eating monster. They are initially unable to stop it, but a distant figure lets out a horrid screech that temporarily stops the Felhound's magic, allowing Kalec to finish it off. They are then confronted by Lor'themar's group, and they band together to try to stop Dar'khan. Meanwhile, Dar'khan takes Anveena to the former sight of SunwelI the source of elven magic, which was destroyed by the undead. Along the way, he explains why he  is taking her there, but in his monologue, Anveena slips off. She is then confronted by a mysterious cloaked figure, who tries to tell her that she was the essence of the Sunwell itself. Anveena doesn't believe him, and soon Dar'khan finds her again. Dar'khan then finds the figure that stopped the Felhound, who proves to be Sylvanas Windrunner, former general of elven forces. She tries to kill him, blaming him for the destruction of her homeland, but he tricks her and takes her prisoner. He then goes to the former site of the Sunwell where he prepares to cast his spell on Anveena, but Lor'themar and his elves attack. They are driven back, but delay him momentarily. Kalec, Tyri, and Jorad then arrive and try to stop Dar'khan. He restrains Kalec with the magical neck collar he put around him in the first book. Tyri is delayed by a massive dragon controlled by Dar'khan, and the hopes of victory look bleak. Raac frees the dragon from Dar'khan's control and they all manage to stop Dar'khan. After he is defeated, the giant dragon is transformed into the cloaked figure Anveena spoke to earlier. He is revealed as Borel, whose real name is Korialstrasz, the consort of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. At the end, Tyri flies Jorad to confront Arthas, Lord of the Undead Scourge, and Anveena stays in Quel'thalas with Kalec and Lor'themar to hide her power.\n\nParagraph 9: After honing his submission skills under Satoru Sayama, Sato made his professional debut in MMA on December 7, 1994, winning over Michael McAuliffe with a calf slicer, the first time the move had been used in mixed martial arts. He ascended fastly in the roster by winning 10 straight matches, becoming a fan favourite for his aggressive and spectacular style of grappling. As soon as his fourth match, he submitted his opponent with a flying inverted triangle choke, and at his seventh, he gained worldwide fame by submitting the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Ricardo Botelho, taking advantage of his guard usage to attack him with leglocks and submit him with a heel hook. Sato also defeated another big name of the art when he beat John Lewis, who he submitted in revenge for a match at the Vale Tudo Japan which ended in a draw. Sato would become a usual fighter for this event, representing Shooto in six out of the nine years it had place.\n\nParagraph 10: NRG Esports signed the Kings of Urban roster after a strong finish in their region in RLCS Season 1 in 2016. RLCS Season 2 saw NRG bow out of the RLCS finals after a loss to Flipsid3 Tactics, finishing 5-6th. In the off-season, GarrettG was picked up from his former team Orbit, replacing Sadjunior. This new roster achieved a 3rd-place finish in the RLCS Season 3 finals, losing out to the eventual champions in Northern Gaming. After a disappointing last-place finish in the RLCS Season 4 Finals, NRG dropped mainstay and fan-favorite Jacob for rookie prodigy jstn. With jstn, NRG came one goal away from becoming the Rocket League world champions in Season 5. After going undefeated in both regular season and the first two days of the RLCS tournament, NRG met Dignitas in the Grand Finals. Dignitas reset the bracket with a 4–1 win in the first best-of-seven, which meant one final series would crown the champs. In Game 7, NRG trailed by one goal in the final moments, but jstn scored a last-second goal to send the game into overtime, where they ultimately lost. NRG would continue to dominate RLCS regional play in seasons 6 and 7, only to fall short of expectations at both finals. Several days after the end of Season 7, NRG legend Fireburner announced he was stepping away from competitive Rocket League. Nearly a month later, it was announced that three-time RLCS champion Turbopolsa, a member of the same Dignitas team that defeated NRG for the world title in season 5, would replace Fireburner, becoming the first player to make a cross-region move from Europe to North America. Months after Turbopolsa's move to North America, NRG Esports would finally go on to win the Rocket League World Championship series on December 15, 2019, beating Renault Vitality in a seven-game Grand Finals with jstn scoring the winning goal in overtime. They would then drop Turbopolsa in order to sign SquishyMuffinz, a player coming from the recently disbanded team Cloud9. With this roster, they went on to win RLCS X North American Championship, and lose in the Grand Finals of Fall Major RLCS 11 to Team BDS. They qualified for the Winter Major as the number 1 seed from NA,they went 1-2 in groups and were placed in the lower bracket against the eventual runner ups Team Queso, which they lost. NRG failed to qualify for the Spring Major, this was the first time NRG failed to qualify for an RLCS international LAN,but they qualified for the RLCS 2021-2022 Finals wildcard in Fort Worth. Although they failed to qualify for the Spring Major they still had enough points to qualify for the Main Event in Fort Worth. Following Version 1's loss against Moist Esports, NRG qualified for the Main Event in Fort Worth as the 3rd seed from North America."}

Holland because of the number of extensive re-writes by the show's creator Gene Roddenberry. Hurley later described the situation as a \"misunderstanding\" as the situation was subsequently resolved and proved to be a turning point for the series in how scripts were produced. Subsequently Roddenberry spent less time conducting detailed re-writes. Some of the elements of Hurley's original story expanded on the back story of Q's species, explaining that there were only three Qs but another hundred thousand residents on their planet who required relocation as the planet was dying. These elements didn't subsequently make it into any future episodes. The episode marked the return of John De Lancie as Q. Cliff Bole was returning as a director for the series, and knowing that de Lancie would appear as Q, Bole watched \"Encounter at Farpoint\" in order to maintain Q's tone. He found after shooting began that his research wasn't required as de Lancie slotted back into his previous role naturally. Bole later described the episode as \"a lot of fun\" and de Lancie as \"a joy and a creative guy to work with\". De Lancie would next return in the second season episode \"Q Who\". Meanwhile, the removal of the character of Deanna Troi from this episode alongside three other episodes made actress Marina Sirtis believe at the time that she was about to be cut from the show.

After the Battle of Antietam on September 17, General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia withdrew across the Potomac.  Lee left a rear guard commanded by Brigadier General William N. Pendleton at Boteler's Ford.  On September 19, elements of the Union V Corps dueled with Pendleton's artillery before pushing a short distance across the river at dusk.  Pendleton inaccurately informed Lee that all of the artillery of the rear guard had been captured.  On the morning of September 20, the Confederates counterattacked with A. P. Hill's Light Division, forcing the Union units back across the Potomac.  One Union unit, the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, did not withdraw at the same time as the others and suffered heavy losses.  Lee's army continued its retreat into the Shenandoah Valley after the battle.\n\nParagraph 3: The backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at Trident Studios in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase. According to Kevin Cann, the lineup featured Bowie on acoustic guitar, Mick Ronson on electric guitar, producer Tony Visconti on bass, Woody Woodmansey on drums and percussion, and Ralph Mace on Moog synthesiser; Ronson and Woodmansey would later become famous as a part of the Spiders from Mars. According to Visconti, Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at Advision Studios, the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name Metrobolist, a homage to Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. Chris O'Leary writes that Bowie wrote the lyrics in the reception area of the studio while Visconti waited at the mixing console. Once he finished, he quickly recorded his vocal, Visconti added a \"flange\" effect and mixed the track in a few hours, sending the tapes to the label later that night. Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing – 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore – I'm through...David was very disappointed.\" This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told BBC Radio 1's Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"\n\nParagraph 4: By 1857, Walker was back on the northern frontier of European colonisation in Australia, employed on Serocold and Mackenzie's Cockatoo station. Here he formulated plans with squatter George Serocold to examine land for occupation in the upper reaches of the Comet River. He set out with another squatter named Wiggins and three Aboriginal men, two of whom were Peabody and Jamie Sandeman, to hunt for these pastoral runs. On returning to Cockatoo, Walker's camp was attacked by local Aboriginals at Conciliation Creek in the Zamia Valley. Walker received two severe spear wounds and with difficulty made his recovery at nearby Palm Tree Creek station owned by squatters Scott and Thompson. At this time the Hornet Bank massacre occurred and Andrew Scott requested assistance from the now recovered Walker to assist with the protection of his newly acquired land. Walker recruited ten of his ex-Native Police troopers and formed a private militia that roamed the Dawson River area conducting punitive missions against local Aboriginal groups. Walker utilised Hornet Bank station as a base and travelled as far as Mount Abundance during his patrols. His troopers included Larry, Boney, Jingle, Billy, Coreen Jemmy and Coreen Neddy. The troopers were actively recruited from the discharged members of the Native Police and were financed by local squatters unhappy with the government run force. George Serocold described the situation as a Border War and even called for the importation of the Cape Mounted Rifles from Africa to give a lesson to \"these savages as will enable us to gain our moral ascendency, let them be made to feel the miseries of war\". The Queensland Government eventually determined that Walker's private militia was illegal and ordered its dissolution in 1859. William Wiseman, the Commissioner for Crown Lands in the region, was sent to the Dawson River to enact the order. He found that Walker's troops were conveniently already dissolved and working on Andrew Scott's Hornet Bank and Pollet Cardew's Eurombah stations as shepherds earning £35 per annum. Frederick Walker was also employed as overseer and ex-Native Police officer Ross was superintendent.\n\nParagraph 5: During the great depression economic opportunities were limited even for educated people like Amjad, who returned to Jhang and joined a weekly newspaper named Arooj. He remained as an editor of the newspaper until 1939 and regularly published his own prose and poetry. At the advent of the Second World War, a poem of his against the British Empire was printed on the front page of Arooj and he was forced to leave the newspaper. After that he found a job as a clerk in the Jhang District Board. In 1944, the government set up a civil supplies department to ration food and clothing. He passed an entrance exam and joined this department and served on with the Food Department until his retirement in 1972. He lived in many small and large towns all over Punjab during his employment with the Food Department including Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Gojra, Muzaffargarh, Rawalpindi, Arifwala, Lahore and Montgomery. In 1939 he married his cousin, a school teacher, but they had different opinions and divorced. Amjad lived the last 28 years in Sahiwal, while his wife stayed in Jhang. He spent last days of life in Farid Town Sahiwal where He died on 11 May 1974.He was buried in lolly Shah Graveyard Jhang.\n\nParagraph 6: Issue 1 holds an 8.2 rating at Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR.com gave issue #1 four out of five stars, calling it \"Millar's strongest new comic in a long time.\" McElhatton praised out Millar's script, in particular the quiet tone of the 1932 sequence that piqued his interest, and the fight scene between Walter and Blackstar, which McElhatton felt represented a unique approach to superhero clichés. McElhatton lauded Frank Quitely's artwork as \"elegant\", in particular his ability to draw the reader's eye toward the center of panels. Compliments were also given to Peter Doherty's colors, which were used well to differentiate between the 1932 and modern scenes. Melissa Grey of IGN gave the issue of 9.2 score of \"Amazing\", lauding the world in the story \"immediately familiar and uniquely original\", and saying that Millar's examination of \"the shades of gray\" between black and white regarding heroes struck a chord unlike any of his previous attempts at the theme of incorporating superhumans into the real world. Grey said of Quitely's artwork that it \"blends a powerful realism with a sense of the fantastical in a way that is seamlessly integrated with Millar's narrative.\" David Brothers of Comics Alliance thought the issue \"fell short\". While Brothers complimented some aspects of the writing and art, such as the 1932 scenes and the psychic paintings, he felt that Millar's characterization and his take on realistic superheroes in the modern scenes was unoriginal, his dialogue in the modern scenes unnatural, that Quitely's characters were not well-designed, and that the book lacked the spectacle by Millar that would've given a better opportunity for Quitely and Doherty to have effected better work. Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool gave the issue a positive review for the depiction of the socioeconomic and political conflicts, Quitely and Doherty's art, and the soap opera plot of the characters' power plays. Patrick Hume of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, calling it an effective, absorbing and smart superhero story that pushes the boundaries of the genre. Hume noted the presence of Millar's trademark black humor and \"full-throttle action\", as well as \"a maturity and thematic sophistication that has not been apparent in other recent work\". Though Hume thought some of Millar's delivery of the issue's ideas was at times heavy-handed, he was impressed enough by the book to continue with it. Hume also thought that Quitely's more defined, gritty, more intimate art was better-suited to the story than the large-scale, widescreen action he effected on The Authority. Doherty's subdued color palette was also noted by Hume.\n\nParagraph 7: Eyes only is jargon used with regard to classified information. Whereas a classified document is normally intended to be available to anyone with the appropriate security clearance, an \"eyes only\" designation, whether official or informal, indicates that the document is intended only for a specific set of readers. As such the document should not be read by other individuals even if they otherwise possess the appropriate clearance. Another meaning is that the document is under no circumstances to be copied or photographed, \"eyes only\" meaning that it is to be physically read by cleared personnel and nothing more, to ensure that no unauthorized copies of the text are made which might be unaccounted for.\n\nParagraph 8: Rangers fan discontent was demonstrated during a Championship game against Queen of the South at Ibrox, with fans holding up red cards in the 18th and 72nd minutes, and this was not improved when, on 3 September, it was revealed that Mike Ashley bought the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium for just £1 in a deal with Charles Green in 2012. Concurrently, Rangers former commercial director Imran Ahmad finally succeeded in a bid to have £620,000 of club assets frozen prior to pursuing litigation over an alleged unpaid £500,000 bonus. A few days later the club were granted leave to appeal this decision yet, on 12 September, the club agreed a settlement with Ahmad much to the dismay of fans. As some Rangers supporters groups considered boycotting home matches in protest at the board, it was revealed that Ashley would not be participating in the share offer. Ashley's motivates for not investing became clear in the following month, namely withholding much needed money from the club in order to undermine the board. At the end of the share issue, on 12 September, it was announced that it had raised just over £3m which still £1m short of its minimum target. As the share issue was undertaken in order to allow Rangers to continue to operate into the new year but the failure to reach the targets meant that further funding was required. A few days later, it came to light that Sandy Easdale had met with several investors that had been introduced to him by Rafat Rizvi, a convicted fraudster wanted by Interpol, which led to calls by the Union of Fans for Easdale to resign. However, in a move to demonstrate his strength, Easdale increased his personal shareholding at Rangers to 5.21% on 24 September. On the same day as the club repaid the £1.5m loan to Sandy Easdale and George Letham. The next day, BNP Paribas bought a 5% stake in Rangers making it the fifth-highest shareholder but less than twenty-fours later it was revealed that the transaction was completed on Ashley's behalf thus increasing his stake to 8.92%. Less than a week later, Ashley's holding company, MASH Holdings, called for an EGM to remove chief executive Wallace. This signaled the start of a crucial stage in the boardroom power struggle at Rangers with King appearing to be outflanked by Ashley, who had secured the support of Sandy Easdale, David Sommers as well as the largest shareholder in Rangers, Laxey Partners.\n\nParagraph 9: At age 18, Dowd was drafted into the military with the rank of sergeant. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945. Dowd planned to obtain a degree in nuclear physics when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.\n\nParagraph 10: Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of all stations from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. The line was mostly underground, except for the section surrounding 125th Street, which ran across the elevated Manhattan Valley Viaduct to cross a deep valley there. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and plastering work. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed."}

It highlights the contextual factors that contribute to this issue, such as misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia. Prejudice and discrimination against SGM populations contribute to minority stress, which leads to health disparities. SGM individuals face barriers to finding refuge from sexual violence and receiving appropriate care due to biases in legislation and domestic violence shelters. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994, although influential, primarily focused on supporting white heterosexual cisgender women and took a carceral approach to funding DV shelters. Research has shown that SGM individuals have been turned away by DV shelters, and compliance with anti-discrimination policies has not been assessed. The VAWA's close link to law enforcement does not align with the needs and desires of survivors from marginalized intersectional identities who mistrust law enforcement. Previous studies have also demonstrated a lack of competence and attunement to servicing SGM survivors in DV shelters. The systemic erasure of SGM individuals denies them services that consider their unique experiences and contributes to their minority stress. Intersectionality plays a role in the nature of sexual assault experiences and access to post-assault services, with African American women, for example, facing high rates of sexual assault but also experiencing stigma that hinders disclosure and seeking support."], "answers": ["Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 10", "Paragraph 1"], "context": "Paragraph 1: The absence of inclusive conversations about sexual assault among LGBTQ, often referred to as sexual and gender minorities (SGM), populations ignores key contextual factors. Unlike heterosexual relationships, this form of violence occurs within the context of a misogynous, homophobic and transphobic world. Prejudice and discrimination experienced by SGM populations contribute to their experience of minority stress. Minority stress posits that prejudice and discrimination against SGM populations cause and maintain health disparities. SGM are less likely than heterosexual victims to find formal refuge from sexual violence and receive appropriate care due to historical biases in legislation and domestic violence shelters tailoring their services towards cisgender and heterosexual victims and lack. Despite the influence of group coalitions led by women of color, disabled women, and transgender women survivors in activism against sexual assault, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 centered a monolithic approach to supporting survivors, primarily who were White heterosexual cisgender women, and took a carceral approach to funding DV shelters (i.e., required survivors to report abusers to law enforcement in order to receive shelter).  A systemic review stated that in 2011, 61% of SGM reported being turned away by domestic violence (DV) shelters. Although in 2013 the Violence Against Women Act explicitly barred discrimination on basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, no follow up research has been done to assess the compliance of DV shelters. The VAWA became so linked to law enforcement involvement, it did not match the approach to accountability and care desired by survivors holding marginalized intersectional identities whom have mistrust of law enforcement. Additionally, older research on DV shelters have demonstrated a lack of competence and attunement to servicing SGM survivors, which often perpetuated harm towards these communities. Systemic erasure of SGM denies victims services that take into account their unique experiences with interpersonal and systemic harm and adds to their minority stress. Minority stress also relates to intersectionality. The theory of intersectionality explores how varied identities held by an individual (i.e., race, SES, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc.) may interact with one another within a given social and political context. The nature of the sexual assault is shaped by the way intersecting identities interact with their social context, often shaping the nature of the sexual assault, the outcomes, and access to services post-assault. For example, African American women experience high rates of sexual assault, often relating to the historic stigmatization and fetishization of African American women sexuality, however, research shows they are less likely to disclose survivorship and seek out support due to stigma.\n\nParagraph 2: Peter Milo Shane (born 1952) is a law professor and writer. His best-known scholarly work focuses mainly on two subjects.  The first is separation of powers law, especially law and the presidency.  His work often explores what he calls an institutional conception of the rule of law in a separation of powers regime.  See, e.g., Peter M, Shane, When Inter-branch Norms Break Down: Of Arms-for-Hostages, 'Orderly Shutdowns,' Presidential Impeachments, and Judicial 'Coups,' 12 Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy 503 (2004). Under Shane's antiformalist conception, the rule of law is sustained not only by formal legal rules, but perhaps most importantly, by informal norms and conventional behaviors designed to maintain interbranch accountability even when public officials could ignore formal rules with impunity.  Peter M. Shane, Madison's Nightmare:  How Executive Power Threatens American Democracy 116 (University of Chicago Press, 2009). Checks and balances in such a system likewise \"depend on an assemblage of norms, cooperative arrangements, and informal coordination activities.\"  Id.  Following political scientist Kenneth Shepsle, Shane thus calls the rule of law \"an unstructured institution.\"  Id.  at 117.Shane's second major focus is cyberdemocracy.  He is particularly interested in the potential of online government initiatives to engage the public more fully in actual policy making. He is a prominent member of the \"cyberrealist school,\" which rejects technological determinism of both the utopian and dystopian kind.  He argues that the democratic potential of digital information technologies depends significantly on human agency, although he perceives the structures of power in society as limiting the impact of any specific initiative.  See, e.g., Peter M. Shane, Democracy Online:  The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet (Routledge, 2004).Madison's Nightmare'' is the major synthesis of Shane's separation of powers views.  It both describes and analyzes the theory and practice of \"presidentialism\" as they unfolded from 1981 to 2009. He describes the period of 1981 to 2009 as a time of aggressive presidentialism.  Presidents Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush made arguments for unilateral presidential authority that Shane characterizes as unprecedented and legally groundless.  These arguments (and the actual assertions of power they supported) went so far beyond the claims of prior presidents as to constitute a new and distinctive phenomenon.  Shane's critique, however, goes beyond his attack on presidentialism as legal doctrine.  He also argues that presidentialism, as an operating ethos of government, undermines sound decision making and the rule of law in executive branch affairs.  He illustrates many of his points through examples from the G. W. Bush administration, but argues that his analysis transcends party.  His view is that, for presidents of either party, presidentialism can subvert the quality of decision making, policy makers' attentiveness to law, and democratic accountability more generally.  \n\nParagraph 3: Among the other earliest chartered or incorporated railroads, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were chartered as passenger services. Later, after mergers, the UNJ&CC became a subsidiary part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) system in New Jersey following the merger and acquisition of several predecessor companies in 1872; these purchases included the PRR's main line to New York City, which is now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Prior to 1872, its main lines were the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C&A) the first railroad in New Jersey and one of the first railroads in the United States.\n\nParagraph 4: Ashoknagar is situated at the average elevation of 507 metres(1640 ft) above sea level. It is in the plateau region. It has an agricultural topography. The plateau is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. In this region, the main classes of soil are black, brown and bhatori (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay-like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high iron content of the basalt from which it is formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand. The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of Chaitra to Jyestha (mid-March to mid-May). The average daily temperature during the summer months is 35 °C, which typically rises to around 46 °C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of Aashaadha (mid-June) and extends to the middle of Ashvin (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon spell, and ranges from about 100 cm in the west to about 165 cm in the east. Ashoknagar and surrounding areas receive an average of 140 cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30 °C, but seldom falls below 20 °C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to Phalgun, i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily temperature ranges from 15 °C to 20 °C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 5 °C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of Pausha and Maagha—known as Mawta—is helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.\n\nParagraph 5: The film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17.1 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is also the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release. It had a worldwide opening of $132.6 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014, and it became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales. Interstellar was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.37 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.36 million), Gravity (£6.24 million), and Inception (£5.91 million). The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total. Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $82.9 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets. It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater. It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million), Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million). Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises. It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share. It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening, and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million) and 2013's Pacific Rim ($45.2 million).\n\nParagraph 6: A Mexican homestead beloved for its Cantina, which serves snacks and root beer. Its other program includes a Mexican dinner, goat-milking, and other farm-related activities and maintenance. It is set in the year 1912. Jesus Gil Abreu and his wife Petra, a daughter of Carlos Beaubien, established the Abreu settlement shortly after Lucien Maxwell's departure from the area in 1857; in addition to a successful ranch. Beaubien died in 1864, leaving the Abreus one-twelfth of the Beaubien-Miranda land grant, which in 1867 they sold to Maxwell for $3,500. Gertrude and Ramon Abreu built a house in the same year on the site that is currently Abreu. The house no longer remains, but its foundations serve as the base of the cantina. Waite Phillips largely abandoned the house, but built what is now called Old Abreu Camp to serve as a logging and sheep-raising center. Under BSA ownership, this became a staffed base in the 1960s, until it burned down twice and flooded three times, the last time being a part of the extensive 1965 floods. Program was shifted back to the old homestead site, known as \"New Abreu\" and later simply as \"Abreu\", where it was initially a camp for western lore and horse rides, and later for burro-packing, hunter safety, and fishing; in its early days it also served as a commissary. One early program which is still active  is the Mexican dinner, though it was moved to Harlan from 1975 to 1990. The cantina program began in 1978 in the old cabin. That same year, with the advent of the adobe program, scouts began construction the current cantina itself as part of the program. It shifted to its present interpretive format in 1989. The new cabin, meant to be an example of a typical house of the period, was built as a conservation project by the cabin restoration crew during the summer and fall of 1998.\n\nParagraph 7: As early as 1804, US Naturalization Acts specifically tied married women's access to citizenship to their state of marriage. Provisions of the Naturalization Act of 1855 extended coverture by tying wives' citizenship and those of her children to the citizenship of their white husband or father. Upon passage of the Expatriation Act of 1907, marriage completely determined a woman's nationality. The law held that all wives acquired their husband's nationality upon any marriage occurring after March 2, 1907. Thus, the immigrant wife of an American man immediately became a US citizen upon marriage, but an American woman who married a foreigner lost her citizenship if her husband was not naturalized. The law was retroactive and loss of citizenship occurred without notice, leaving many women unaware that they had lost their US citizenship.\n\nParagraph 8: The methodology of revisions, has led to a certain controversy. Specifically, questions have been raised about the way the cost of aforementioned previous actions such as cross currency swaps was estimated, and why it was retroactively added to the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 budget deficits, rather than to those of earlier years, more relevant to the transactions. However, Eurostat and ELSTAT have explained in detail in public reports from November 2010 that the proper recording of off-market swaps that was carried out in November 2010 increased the stock of debt for each year for which the swaps were outstanding (including the years 2006–2009) by about 2.3 percent of GDP but at the same time decreased -not increased- the deficit for each of these years by about 0.02 percent of GDP. Regarding the latter, the Eurostat report explains: \" at the same time [as the upward correction of the debt stock], there must be a correction throughout the whole period for the deficit of Greece, as the flows of interest under the swap contract are reduced by an amount equal to the part of any settlement flows relating to the amortisation of the loan (this is a financial transaction with no impact on the deficit), whereas interest on the loan are still imputed as expenditure.\" Further questions involve the way deficits of several legal entities from the non-financial corporations in the General Government sector were estimated and retroactively added to the same years' (2006 to 2009) budget deficits. Nevertheless, both Eurostat and ELSTAT have explained in public reports how the previous misclassification of certain (17 in number) government enterprises and other government entities outside the General Government sector was corrected as they did not meet the criteria for being classified outside the General Government. As the Eurostat report noted, \"Eurostat discovered that the ESA 95 rules for classification of state owned units were not being applied.\" In the context of this controversy, the former head of Greece's statistical agency, Andreas Georgiou, has been accused of inflating Greece's budget deficit for the aforementioned years. He was cleared of charges of inflating Greece's deficit in February 2019. It has been argued by many international as well as Greek observers that \"despite overwhelming evidence that Mr. Georgiou correctly applied EU rules in revising Greece’s fiscal deficit and debt figures, and despite strong international support for his case, some Greek courts continued the witch hunt.\"\n\nParagraph 9: That night, Maxwell, still partly delirious, strips naked and ventures out with a video camera, intending to document the paranormal phenomena. He captures the spectral herd of Caribou passing on camera before something strikes him from behind. When he is found dead out on the snow the next morning, Hoffman suspects that sour gas (natural gas containing hydrogen sulfide) may have been leaked out as a result of runaway climate change (arctic methane release).  The sour gas might then be provoking hallucinations and insanity in the group. Elliot, Hoffman's partner, attempts to email the outside world, but can't get a signal; he then dies shortly thereafter, possibly of a brain aneurysm. Hoffman had refused to sign off on permission for heavy equipment to be brought in to help move drilling equipment due to potential damage to the tundra earlier in the film; Pollack and his boss, Foster, arrange for Hoffman to be replaced as a result. Hoffman convinces Ed to travel with the team to a hospital for examination after Elliot's death; however, the bush plane arriving to pick them up crashes into their building, badly damaging it. Gary, the pilot, and the replacement environmental scientist, Marshowitz, are both killed in the crash; Foster is horrifically burned, but manages to live out the night before dying. Native Alaskan worker Lee vanishes without a trace the next morning; the sound of hooves, the same sound which occurred prior to each appearance of the ghostly caribou, is heard. The only thing left are his boots, still propped up as if someone was standing in them. His fellow Native Alaskan worker, Dawn goes insane shortly thereafter and murders Motor, the station mechanic, who had been injured when the plane crashed into the building. Abby stumbles upon the scene and, in an altercation with Dawn, pushes her over a shelf, causing Dawn to fall and break her neck.\n\nParagraph 10: On November 20, Ohata combined her two tag teams with Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto to form a trio named Kuros for a 6-Person Tag Tournament. In their first round 20-minute Point Dash match, the three defeated Meat Tech (Hiroyo Matsumoto, Ryo Mizunami and Sawako Shimono) 5–4, following a sudden death round. On November 27, Kuros defeated Classic Gohan (Cherry, Mika Iida and Shuu Shibutani) to advance to the finals of the tournament, a captain's fall match, where they were defeated by Revolucion Yoko Hatanaka (Gami, Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa). Following the tournament, Kuros remained together as a three-woman stable. On December 15, Ohata won her second Zan1 tournament, earning another shot at the Wave Single Championship. Ohata received her title shot on January 26, 2014, but her match with Yumi Ohka ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw. From May 11 to July 4, Ohata took part in the round-robin portion of the 2014 Catch the Wave tournament, finishing with a record of three wins, two draws and one loss, advancing to the knockout stage after a win over Mio Shirai in their final round-robin match. On July 27, Ohata first defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto in the first round and then Yumi Ohka in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the 2014 Catch the Wave, where she was defeated by Hikaru Shida. On September 15, Ohata and Mio Shirai unsuccessfully challenged Sakuragohan (Mika Iida and Kyusei Sakura Hirota) for the Wave Tag Team Championship, which also forced them to start the upcoming 2014 Dual Shock Wave from the first round. On September 23, Ohata and Shirai defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yumi Ohka in the first round of the tournament. On October 1, Ohata and Shirai defeated Dynamite Kansai and Fairy Nipponbashi to advance to the semifinals of the tournament, where, later that same event, they wrestled Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Ohata was then defeated by Kimura in an overtime singles match and, as a result, both she and Shirai were eliminated from the tournament. On November 26, Kuros won the second annual One Day 6-Person Tag Tournament, defeating Cherry, Meari Naito and Shuu Shibutani in the finals and, as a result, earned the right to produce the December 14 Wave event. In early 2015, Ohata and Shirai received two shots at the Wave Tag Team Championship, but were both times defeated by the defending champions, Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata. Finally, in the third title match between the two teams, Ohata and Shirai defeated Hamada and Yamagata on March 15 to become the new Wave Tag Team Champions. They made their first successful title defense on April 19 against Kaho Kobayashi and Tsukasa Fujimoto. On August 20, Kuros produced their final independent event, before the stable's dissolution, where Ohata, Fujimoto and Shirai defeated Chikayo Nagashima, Kayoko Haruyama and Meiko Satomura in a six-woman tag team main event. On September 13, Ohata and Shirai made their second successful defense of the Wave Tag Team Championship against Hiroyo Matsumoto and Ryo Mizunami. On September 20, Ohata and Shirai relinquished the Wave Tag Team Championship at the end of Shirai's retirement event."}

In 2011, she made a guest appearance on a drama TV show as a ballet coach, playing a serious character.", "The text discusses the activities of a Russian businessman named Anton Bakov, who in 2014 proposed that Prince Karl Emich take up the Russian Throne and form a new and independent state. Bakov purchased a plot of land in Montenegro to give the new state a location and aimed to establish an offshore zone there to provide financial intermediation to Russian companies. He also had talks with authorities in neighboring Macedonia and Albania for collaboration and state recognition. Bakov also held discussions with several political leaders and religious figures, including the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, the President of Gambia, and the Eastern Orthodox clergy of Macedonia and Montenegro.", "The Captain is revived by Merlyn in the dimension called Otherworld, while the Fury, a dangerous entity, adapts itself to travel between dimensions to hunt down the Captain.

Describing, in detail, an advanced universal astrolabe of Blagrave's design - incorporating the designs of earlier astrolabists. The 'jewel' consisted of four movable parts - Mater, Rete, Label, and Rule - which were lavishly illustrated in the book's frontispiece and engraved plates. The 'jewel's' uses were described in the third book as being used for anything from trigonometry, to navigation, to astrology; in Blagrave's words from the 'jewel' one could draw \"so infinite a number of conclusions, more than I thinke I shall ever have time to write\". The astrolabe contains some significant similarities to the universal astrolabe of Andalusian astrolabist Ali ibn Khalaf and David A. King has suggested that Blagrave copied his design for the 'Jewel' from ibn Khalaf.\n\nParagraph 2: The HTTP scheme was designed by Phillip Hallam-Baker at CERN in 1993 and does not incorporate subsequent improvements in authentication systems, such as the development of keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). Although the cryptographic construction that is used is based on the MD5 hash function, collision attacks were in 2004 generally believed to not affect applications where the plaintext (i.e. password) is not known. However, claims in 2006 cause some doubt over other MD5 applications as well. So far, however, MD5 collision attacks have not been shown to pose a threat to digest authentication, and the RFC 2617 allows servers to implement mechanisms to detect some collision and replay attacks.\n\nParagraph 3: In early 2007, Walter had a supporting role as Mabel the bartender in the MyNetworkTV soap opera Watch Over Me. Later that May she served as a judge on the ABC reality TV show The Next Best Thing, which searched for the best celebrity impersonators in America. In early 2008, Walter was in the comedy film Drillbit Taylor, and also starred on the VH1 reality series Celebracadabra, in which celebrities competed to see who was the best magician among them. She made it to the final three but was eliminated in the sixth episode. She has developed a series for the Oxygen network called Dance Your Ass Off. On December 19, 2011, she appeared on Rizzoli & Isles as a ballet coach, J.J. It was far from her usual role, as she played a very serious character in a drama.\n\nParagraph 4: This episode may contain the highest amount of cultural references in a single airing, many of which are in rapid succession in the first half. In the beginning of the episode, when they are in Joe's home theater, Joe appears rolling across the ground in a parody of the 1984-1993 TriStar Pictures logo. The television show that Peter and Lois watch entitled Fast Talking High Trousers, which parodied 1940s films, was conceived by Wellesley Wild. The episode's title and plot references the horror film Poltergeist. The episode references the finale of the NBC sitcom Friends and its sequel Joey, also referencing the cancellation of Joey. To cheer himself up, Stewie at one point imagines himself on the show Jackass. In one scene, Chris is frightened by Ronald McDonald, and is saved from an evil tree by Herbert, who fights the tree in a The Lord of the Rings-style battle. When Peter is clawing at his face, he transforms into Hank Hill from King of the Hill. While trapped inside the spirit world, Stewie learns he can communicate through the TV, and he sings the second verse of the Phil Collins song \"In the Air Tonight\" with the same fuzzy reverb vocal effect used in the recorded song. While shooting golf balls through the portal, Peter remarks \"we are going to get those terrorists, now watch this drive.\" A reference to a televised interview on a golf course in which President George W. Bush said the same thing before hitting a ball. Peter also references Bugs Bunny by sticking his head out of Meg's butt and claiming he took a wrong turn at Albuquerque. The scene of Peter taking the TV back in and putting Meg out referenced the end of the original film Poltergeist, where the family's father removes the television set after the family flees to a motel room. JAG is also shown, commenting how the show has run its course, the last episode of the series having aired on April 29, 2005. When the Griffin family approaches Carrot Top's mansion, the theme from Back to the Future is used. A cutaway gag refers the Dick Cheney hunting accident, which Cheney shooting down Peter multiple times, afterwards claiming he thought he was a deer. While feeding the skull, Peter says, \"Want some more Peas Chief Diamond Phillips\", a reference to Actor Lou Diamond Phillips who is part Cherokee Indian. Towards the end of the episode, Stewie mentions that he met Jesus and he was Chinese with the last name Hong. This could possibly be a reference to the Taiping Rebellion, which was led by a man who believed himself to be the brother of Jesus with the name Hong.\n\nParagraph 5: The town hall (Rathaus) is surely one of Duchroth's oldest buildings. It is believed to have been built in the 16th century, although there are no documents establishing this. Undertaken in 1982, at a cost of some €225,000, was a thorough renovation led by the Didion architectural agency. On the strength of the structural survey by the architects, the time of building was reckoned to be the 11th or 12th century, not the 16th. This is likelier, since the town hall was built in the Gothic style. According to Didion, the building comes from the oldest time of the Gothic period. All buildings in the area built in the Gothic style that still stand today are made of quarrystone and slate material. The back and gables are in typical Gothic style and well preserved. Regrettably, the windows on the street side have been enlarged and the Gothic façade no longer appears in its original form. On the righthand gable side is found a round-arched window. It is richly moulded and the keystone bears an image of a mask hewn into the stone. The column with the top beam, which is still standing near the entrance, suggests that there was once a great space, opened to the outside here. Once sitting on the roof was a ridge turret that held one of the Palatinate's most interesting bells. The bell's shape alone suggests that it was very old, likewise the puzzling inscription upon the rim: “+ O A S O +”, likely standing for OMNIA AD SALVTEM OMNIVM, meaning “Everything to everyone’s Salvation”. The bell is believed to have come from Disibodenberg Abbey, whose six bells were shared out after Secularization to villages that had in bygone times been subject to the old abbey. The bell measured 68 cm across and was made of prime cast iron. Akin in shape was a bell from Aachen, which was cast in 1261. In 1894, the bell was fetched down from the ridge turret and sold for a few Pfennig, because it had cracked. The turret itself was torn down after the Second World War because it had fallen into disrepair. In its long, eventful history, the Rathaus has served not only for meetings and consultations of the municipal representatives and the clubs, but also as a prison (windows with iron grilles), a prison camp, a courthouse, a schoolhouse, a dwelling, a shelter in case of war, a storehouse, a garage for the hearse (in a leanto shed) and a communal bakehouse.\n\nParagraph 6: The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld. The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down. Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, Earth-616.  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so.  Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans. The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans. The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238. Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain. The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.\n\nParagraph 7: If the form is indefinite and even we may as well assume that it is of nonpositive signature by changing orientations if necessary, in which case it is isomorphic to a sum of m copies of II1,1 and 2n copies of E8(−1) for some m and n. If m ≥ 3n (so that the dimension is at least 11/8 times the |signature|)  then there is a smooth structure, given by taking a connected sum of n K3 surfaces and m − 3n copies of S2×S2. If m ≤ 2n (so the dimension is at most 10/8 times the |signature|) then Furuta proved that no smooth structure exists . This leaves a small gap between 10/8 and 11/8 where the answer is mostly unknown. (The smallest case not covered above has n=2 and m=5, but this has also been ruled out, so the smallest lattice for which the answer is not currently known is the lattice II7,55 of rank 62 with n=3 and m=7. See  for recent (as of 2019) progress in this area.) The \"11/8 conjecture\" states that smooth structures do not exist if the dimension is less than 11/8 times the |signature|.\n\nParagraph 8: While still building on traditional models such as the Ricardian framework, the mid 1900s bring forth innovation in international trade theory with the introduction of the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, developed by Swedish economists Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin from the Stockholm School of Economics. The H-O model advances international trade theory by introducing the concept of factor endowments within a country as well as the underlying causes for differences in comparative costs between countries, while assuming countries will have identical production technologies. The H-O framework finds that countries have differing comparative costs even though they have the same production technologies due to differences in factors of production, such as the geographical abundance of natural resources or population size. Furthermore, what the H-O model concludes is that traded commodities are essentially bundles of factors (land, labor, and capital) and therefore the international trade of commodities is indirect factor arbitrage (Leamer 1995).The H-O model more accurately describes international trade patterns in modern times (post WWII) due to the increased ability of transferring knowledge/ production technologies between countries, mainly focusing on factorial differences such as labor force and resource allocation as to why countries trade with each other.The Ricardian model of comparative advantage has trade ultimately motivated by differences in labour productivity using different \"technologies\". Heckscher and Ohlin did not require production technology to vary between countries, so (in the interests of simplicity) the \"H–O model has identical production technology everywhere\". Ricardo considered a single factor of production (labour) and would not have been able to produce comparative advantage without technological differences between countries (all nations would become autarkic at various stages of growth, with no reason to trade with each other). The H–O model removed technology variations but introduced variable capital endowments, recreating endogenously the inter-country variation of labour productivity that Ricardo had imposed exogenously. With international variations in the capital endowment like infrastructure and goods requiring different factor \"proportions\", Ricardo's comparative advantage emerges as a profit-maximizing solution of capitalist's choices from within the model's equations. The decision that capital owners are faced with is between investments in differing production technologies; the H–O model assumes capital is privately held.\n\nParagraph 9: Amaral was born in 1933 in Pleasanton, California, USA. His father was Portuguese and his mother was American of Italian descent. Amaral grew up in a rural environment in Pleasanton and remembers that period as \"living in an interior exile\". As a teenager he wrote poetry, which has always been his great source of inspiration. And years later it turned out to be vice versa - because of the lyrical aspect of Amaral's sculptures, drawings, oil paintings and graphic works, these have become illustrations for poems by such poets as Edoardo Sanguineti or Armando Rojas Guardia.After two years at the University of Washington, Seattle (1952–53) where he studied, among other subjects, history of art and architecture, Amaral finally decided for a career in the arts at the Stanford University and in 1954 graduated with a title Bachelor of Arts. \"When I abandoned United States I realized that art is my only option, the only place where I am not a foreigner\". He continued postgraduate studies at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1954-1955), where he met Colombian visual artist and future wife Olga de Amaral (got married in Colombia in December 1957). Before moving to Bogotá in 1958, Amaral spent two years (1955–57) in the Philippine Islands with the U.S. Navy (obligatory military service). In Bogotá, Amaral started working with a furniture and interior design company. Soon his son was born and Amaral decided to become a full-time artist and began casting bronze sculptures, making collages and abstract drawings. In 1960 his daughter was born. From 1966 to 1967 the Amaral family moved temporarily to New York. In 1967, after coming back to Colombia, Amaral traveled to the US again to teach drawing at the Penland School of the Arts and Crafts in North Carolina. In the same year he also started teaching drawing at the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano in Bogotá. In the years 1970-1972 the Amaral family traveled around Europe, settling down for a longer period in Paris, where in the fall of 1971, at the Albert Loeb gallery, Amaral showed his work for the first time in Europe. The exhibition brought him great critical acclaim. He traveled to Paris again for longer periods in the years 1974-1975 and 1979-1980. In 1989 Amaral taught drawing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Currently he lives with his wife in Bogotá and works in Casa Amaral.\n\nParagraph 10: In early 2014, Bakov announced he views the Russian Throne (See), from the point of international law, as matters of state sovereignty (regardless of any other attributes, referring to analogues with The Holy See). He outlined that Karl Emich, upon accepting the Orthodox religion, received the right to take up this See according to the pre-Revolution Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire. Bakov proposed that the Prince should accept the Throne to form a new and independent state, and incorporate it into Bakov's promotional projects such as the Monarchist Party, virtual state of Russian Empire among others. In April 2014, Bakov and Karl Emich appeared in a newspaper report declaring the Prince accepted the proposals as well as the title of Emperor Nicholas III (successor to Nicholas II). In the report, Bakov emphasized that Karl Emich has been an entrepreneur for a long time, but that from now on, he is barred from performing all non-Throne related activity. The report contained a \"Manifesto of granting the Constitution to the State\", signed by Nicholas III, proclaiming the formation of the sovereign state \"Imperial See\" aimed at consolidating all the people around the world devoted to Christian Monarchism. The See in the documents is viewed as the legacy of the first-ever Christian Roman Imperial Throne of Constantine the Great, passed through the Byzantine Empire to the Russian Empire and the House of Romanov by religious procedures. Later Bakov announced that he had purchased a plot of land in Montenegro to give the new state a location (80 ha, \"twice as big as Vatican\"), and was in negotiations with Montenegro's authorities on the state's recognition. He also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to grant such a plot in Yekaterinburg (Bakov's residence and place of 1918 Romanov assassination) in response to Karl Emich's request passed to Putin by Bakov, a former MP. In early 2015, as a follow-up to the International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis, Bakov told the press there are talks with Montenegro authorities to establish an offshore zone at this plot, aimed at providing financial intermediation to Russian companies. Also in early 2015, Imperial Throne representatives were in talks with the authorities of the neighboring Republic of Macedonia and Albania on possible collaboration and future state recognition. In particular, Bakov held a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. Later there were the also talks with then President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh at the 70th UN General Assembly session in USA. Also, talks were held with Macedonian and Montenegro Eastern Orthodox clergy — Bakov discussed the creation of churches associated with the Imperial Throne and proposed the canonization of Russian ancient ruler Ivan III and his wife Sophia Palaiologina. Talks with Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, also took place, as well as extended talks with authorities of Gambia and Kiribati."}

Created by Twyla Tharp, the musical follows a group of American youth growing up on Long Island in the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The main characters are based on various Joel songs, and the show differs from traditional musicals as it primarily consists of dance numbers linked by a thin plot. The dancers do not sing, and instead, the vocals are performed by a pianist and band representing Billy Joel.

The legal age of marriage is 18, but judges may in special cases allow earlier marriage. A man may marry up to four wives; if so, he must treat them equally and inform them in advance, and they may demand a divorce. Marriage requires the consent of both parties and a gift by the groom of a dowry to the bride, as well as the presence of the bride's father or guardian (wali) and of two witnesses.  The father of the bride may block the marriage, although her guardian may not.  The marriage must be registered before a notary or legal functionary. Marriage is forbidden between close relatives by descent, marriage, or nursing: thus a man may not marry his mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepmother-in-law, or stepdaughter-in-law, nor may he marry anyone who suckled from the same woman as he did, or from whom he suckled.  A man may not be married to two sisters simultaneously. Marriage is also forbidden between a couple who have divorced each other for the third time, unless the wife has since been married to someone else. A Muslim woman may not marry a non-Muslim man, and a marriage may be annulled on the grounds of the spouse's apostasy. A husband is required to provide for his wife to the best of his abilities, and to treat his wives equally if he marries more than one. A wife is required to obey her husband and respect him as head of the family, to bring up and nurse his children, and to respect his parents and relatives.   A wife has the right to visit her parents and to receive visits from them, and has rights over her own property.\n\nParagraph 3: As top-40 radio became dominant on AM in the late 1950s, the Yankee Network continued to program for an audience that was now aging. In fact, at many stations, the programming content was undergoing a number of changes: for one thing, few stations had live orchestras any more. With television becoming popular, many programs previously heard only on radio moved over to TV. Even soap operas, long a staple of network programming on radio, ceased in 1960. Also during this time period, many stations stopped relying on syndicated programs from NBC, CBS, ABC, or Mutual and began to do their own programming:  in Boston, for example, WBZ ended its long affiliation with NBC to program its own music, using live and local announcers. Just like with WBZ, the emphasis at many radio stations had shifted to playing records.  As the top-40 hit format proliferated, in an effort to attract the growing youth audience, WNAC and the Yankee Network stayed with the older music; this earned them praise from a number of newspaper columnists, many of whom were also getting older and found top-40 unpleasant.  For them, WNAC's and the Yankee Network's emphasis on \"great standards\" and songs with \"beautiful melodies\" was very comforting.  The Yankee stations, especially flagship WNAC, played the music that the older audience enjoyed, avoiding songs that were popular with young people and focusing on \"easy listening\" music.  One popular announcer during this time was Gus Saunders, who was also well known as the host of another of the Yankee Network's cooking programs; in addition, Saunders announced some of the network's sports events, such as Boston's BAA Marathon. Another popular announcer was Vin Maloney, who like Saunders, fulfilled a wide range of functions for WNAC and the Yankee Network, including announcing, news-reading, and covering sports.  The Yankee News Service remained popular throughout the 1950s, and listeners relied on it for local news and sports; this was especially true in the summer of 1957, when Boston's newspapers went on strike.  WNAC, WNAC-TV, and the entire Yankee Network increased the amount of hourly newscasts, added more news bulletins, and sent out members of its Boston staff to post news headlines on billboards around the city.\n\nParagraph 4: Musashi made his entrance into kickboxing and K-1 debut with an impressive knockout victory over fellow karate competitor Patrick Smith in 1995. Despite this initial splash, his first three years with the organization were mostly marked by loss, and he emerged from 1998 with a K-1 record of 4-8-1 (1). The following year saw a reversal in fortune, as Musashi secured his rival Kirkwood Walker’s WAKO Pro World Muay Thai Heavyweight title and won his first tournament – the K-1 Spirits '99 Japanese Grand Prix. The year ended with him earning entry to the K-1 Grand Prix '99 Final Round, but advancing no further than the quarter finals.\n\nParagraph 5: To place multiferroic materials in their appropriate historical context, one also needs to consider magnetoelectric materials, in which an electric field modifies the magnetic properties and vice versa. While magnetoelectric materials are not necessarily multiferroic, all ferromagnetic ferroelectric multiferroics are linear magnetoelectrics, with an applied electric field inducing a change in magnetization linearly proportional to its magnitude. Magnetoelectric materials and the corresponding magnetoelectric effect have a longer history than multiferroics, shown in blue in the graph to the right. The first known mention of magnetoelectricity is in the 1959 Edition of Landau & Lifshitz' Electrodynamics of Continuous Media which has the following comment at the end of the section on piezoelectricity: \"Let us point out two more phenomena, which, in principle, could exist. One is piezomagnetism, which consists of linear coupling between a magnetic field in a solid and a deformation (analogous to piezoelectricity). The other is a linear coupling between magnetic and electric fields in a media, which would cause, for example, a magnetization proportional to an electric field. Both these phenomena could exist for certain classes of magnetocrystalline symmetry. We will not however discuss these phenomena in more detail because it seems that till present, presumably, they have not been observed in any substance.\" One year later, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii showed using symmetry arguments that the material Cr2O3 should have linear magnetoelectric behavior, and his prediction was rapidly verified by D. Astrov. Over the next decades, research on magnetoelectric materials continued steadily in a number of groups in Europe, in particular in the former Soviet Union and in the group of H. Schmid at U. Geneva. A series of East-West conferences entitled Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals (MEIPIC) was held between 1973 (in Seattle) and 2009 (in Santa Barbara), and indeed the term \"multi-ferroic magnetoelectric\" was first used by H. Schmid in the proceedings of the 1993 MEIPIC conference (in Ascona).\n\nParagraph 6: The son of Jean, Duke of Guise, Henri was forbidden to enter France for much of his life. Nonetheless, he remained devoted to serving France, having enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and fighting in World War II and the Algerian War. After being permitted to re-enter France in 1950, he soon became heavily engaged in French monarchist politics. Henri worked to restore the French monarchy, in a parliamentary form, and discussed the topic with Charles de Gaulle. He received notable support from French monarchists, but all attempts to restore the monarchy ultimately failed. Upon his death in 1999, his son Henri succeeded him as Head of the House of Orléans.\n\nParagraph 7: In Asia, following the announcement of the tour, the first shows in Seoul sold out in a matter of minutes, resulting in server crashes due to high traffic. In Mainland China, BigBang gathered a record-breaking 280,000 people in attendance from 13 shows, making the tour the most attended concert tour by a foreign act of all time in China, with three sold-out shows in Shanghai making BigBang the only Korean act to hold three concerts in a row at Mercedes-Benz Arena and sold-out show in Chengdu, as BigBang held the largest audience drew by a Korean act for a single concert in China with 30,000 attending the show. Further sold-out shows in Guangzhou, Beijing, Dalian and Wuhan. In Hong Kong all three shows sold out in less than two hours after they went on sale, making BigBang the first non-Chinese singer to sell out three concerts in Hong Kong on two separate occasions The Macau two nights sold out within 3 hours leading to a third show being added, making them the first ever foreign artist group to hold three consecutive shows at The Venetian Macao, attracting over 28,598 fans with gross $5.3 million, and ranked the group at number 41 on the Top 100 International Boxoffice Grosses of the year at Pollstars year end list. In Singapore, demand was so high that \"audio seats\" were put on sale after regular tickets quickly sold out. In Malaysia, hundreds of fans lined up in advance to purchase tickets for the July 25 concert, which eventually sold out in a matter of hours. Due to high demand, a second show was added on July 24, making them the first Korean act to hold a two-day concert in Kuala Lumpur. in Japan BigBang became the first foreign artist holding a dome tour for the third consecutive year, the tour sold out and 4 new shows added in Tokyo Dome and Fukuoka Dome due to high demand. the tour that drew 911,000 fans in Japan making it the most attended concert tour by a foreign act of all time in the country. In Australia, a second show was added in Sydney after high demand, the tour became the highest-grossing and most-attended tour by Korean artists in the country. with $5.8 million from 35,000 tickets sold in 3 shows. In North America, the tour became the most attended tour by Korean act as it was listed on Pollstars year end list, on the Top 200 North American Tours, BigBang ranked at number 126 and earned $7.8 million from four reported shows. in Mexico they performed their most-attended concert outside Asia with 15,000 tickets sold at Mexico City Arena. In Canada they performed Infront of 14,000 fans making it the attended concert by a Korean act of all time in the counrty.

The one holdout, Swiss Professor Winterhalter, is convinced that Hinkle is a fake. With no medical evidence to base their case on, O'Brien, Thompson and Kincaid hire Cleveland's best private detective, Chester Purkey, to keep Hinkle under constant surveillance. However, Gingrich sees Purkey entering the apartment building across the street and lets Hinkle know they are being watched and recorded - and after Sandy arrives, warns him not to indulge in any hanky panky with her. He proceeds to feed misinformation to Purkey; he incorporates the \"Harry Hinkle Foundation\", a non-profit charity to which all the proceeds of any settlement are to go, above and beyond the medical expenses. When Sandy questions Gingrich about this in private, he tells her that it is just a scam to put pressure on the insurance company to settle, and that there will be enough money in the settlement for everyone. Hinkle begins to enjoy having Sandy back again, but he feels bad when he sees that Boom-Boom is so guilt-ridden, his performance on the field suffers; he is booed by the fans and then grounded by the team for getting drunk and involved in a bar fight.\n\nParagraph 9: Movin' Out is a 2002 jukebox musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel. Conceived and created by Twyla Tharp, the musical tells the story of a generation of American youth growing up on Long Island during the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The principal characters are drawn from those who appeared in various Joel tunes: high school sweethearts Brenda and Eddie (\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\"), James (\"James\"), Judy (\"Why Judy Why\"), and Tony (Anthony in \"Movin' Out\"). The show diverts from the traditional musical in that it essentially is a series of dances linked by a thin plot, and none of the dancers sing. Instead, all the vocals are performed by a pianist (the \"Piano Man\", representing Billy Joel) and band suspended on a platform above the stage while the dancers act out the songs' lyrics, basically making the show a rock ballet.\n\nParagraph 10: Between 1438 and 1446 (several decades before the activities of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin on a wide variety of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a folding ladder and a gem polishing machine. Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Liège's Speculum musicae. The best known part is his treatise on the design and construction of musical instruments, containing, amongst others, the earliest illustration of a harpsichord. He gave  a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. His description of the organ is more practical than earlier treatises, describing the composition of the diapason chorus and the scaling of the pipes. He describes the layout of pipes, either with the longest in the middle, \"in the form of a bishop's mitre\", or in chromatic order, longest at the left, and he is credited with the first mention of reed pipes. All instruments in his manuscript were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295)."}

The company originated in 1884 as the  (Society for German Colonisation) with the aim of trading in Africa. The German protectorate of Wituland (within modern Kenya) originated as a separate German sphere of influence in 1885. In April of the same year, the company leased the coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years. Its attempt to take over the administration led to a general revolt along the coast of what is now Tanzania. The company could only hold Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo with the help of the German navy. In 1889 it had to request the assistance of the German government to put down the rebellion. In 1891, after it became apparent that the company could not handle its dominions, it sold out to the German government, which began to rule German East Africa directly. The company initially continued to operate its many activities, including mines, plantations, railways, banking, minting, etc., before it consented to relinquish them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. It subsequently operated as a land company within the German territory until Britain occupied German East Africa during World War I.\n\nParagraph 2: Because of its numerous printers and publishers, Saint‑Germain‑des‑Prés, and especially the Cordeliers Section of what is now the 6th arrondissement, became centers of revolutionary activity after 1789; they produced thousands of pamphlets, newspapers, and proclamations which influenced the Parisian population and that of France as a whole. The prison of the Abbey of Saint‑Germain‑des‑Prés, a two-storey building near the church, was filled with persons who had been arrested for suspicion of counter-revolutionary motives: former aristocrats, priests who refused to accept the revolutionary Constitution, foreigners, and so forth. By September 1792, Paris prisons were quite full. The former king and queen were political prisoners and were moved from the Tuileries Palace to the old Knights Templar towers on the right bank, where there was less risk of rescue or escape. France was at war; the Duke of Brunswick had just issued his menacing manifesto, stating that if the former monarchy were not restored, he would raze Paris, and his troops were only a few days away. Now these political prisoners began to be viewed as a genuine threat, should any of them be conspiring with France's enemies. In what was a planned but inhumane tactic, politicians at Paris sent bands of criminals, armed mainly with pikes and axes, into each prison. Although at least one deputy from the Convention accompanied each band, the results were horrifying. Hundreds of prisoners were cut down in the first week in September. As Englishman Arthur Young noted, the street outside one prison literally ran red with blood. The former Cordeliers Convent, closed by the revolutionaries, became the headquarters of one of the most radical factions, whose leaders included Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins, though both would be run out by ever more extreme factions. The radical revolutionary firebrand, Swiss physician Jean-Paul Marat, lived in the Cordeliers Section. \n\nParagraph 3: Due to its strategic location, currencies from several countries began circulating in Puerto Rico and used as trade. The government often ordered the collection of these coins in exchange for exchange notes. The first of these took place in 1857, when a royal decree ordered the gathering of macuquina coins. These arrived to Puerto Rico in 1813, originally produced by Spain in Venezuela. Due to Spanish manufacture, the exchange notes issued for the macuquina featured a 12.5% discount, which left a significant deficit in the government's budget. A decade later, coins were brought from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico. Consequently, the distribution of foreign coins received authorization. In 1879, the circulation of Mexican silver was approved in government and official entities, eventually allowing public distribution in 1881. However, some saw an opportunity for profit in this and bought Mexican pesos outside of Puerto Rico before importing them, in the process gaining a profit of up to 40 centavos per peso. In 1884, a number of different coins were countermarked with a fleur-de-lis for circulation on Puerto Rico. Spanish 2, 4 and 8 reales, and 5 and 10 centimos, United States' 20 cents, quarters, halves and dollars were all countermarked and used until they were redeemed in 1894. By 1895, the coins circulating in Puerto Rico were mostly Mexican silver, creating a shortage of currency. To resolve this, Spain issued a Royal Decree stating that the Mexican coins were to be replaced by ones minted in Madrid, with special coins created exclusively for Puerto Rico. To execute this move, exchange notes in one-peso denomination were created. Once the exchange concluded in 1896, the provincial coin was already in circulation. Silver 20 centavos and 1 peso coins were introduced in 1895, followed in 1896 by silver 5, 10 and 40 centavos. The 1 peso coins bore the denomination as \"1 PESO = 5 P.TAS\". These exchanges heavily affected the government's economy. Some years later, Ceredo Millán a commercial firm in San Juan obtained some of the now-obsolete Exchange Notes, which were converted into souvenirs and offered as gifts to their clients.\n\nParagraph 4: On 7 May 2018, the Federal Ministry of the Interior announced the results of an internationally open program competition for the building academy to be rebuilt. In August 2018, Berlin's Senator for Construction Katrin Lompscher (Die Linke) spoke out in favor of the reconstruction of the Bauakademie under the motto \"As much Schinkel as possible\". The implementation competition for the building should \"take into account Schinkel's specifications for the building, structure and facade\". In January 2019, the Federal Bauakademie Foundation was founded as the supporting organization for the reconstruction of the building. In November 2019, the SPD politician Florian Pronoldas the founding director and in January 2020 the cultural manager Julia Rust von Krosigk was elected as the vice director of the Bundesstiftung Bauakademie. Pronold's election provoked criticism in parts of the architecture community, which the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Building Academy and Pronold himself rejected. Two competitors filed a lawsuit against the recruitment process. On 7 January, the labor court in Berlin issued an injunction in the proceedings of the plaintiff Philipp Oswalt , which prohibited the foundation from filling the director's position with Pronold, as the proceedings did not meet the requirements of the best selection that apply to public office. On 10 March 2020, Pronold announced that it would not take up the position as director On 12 June, the regional labor court confirmed the temporary injunction as a second instance on the grounds that the Federal Bauakademie Foundation is \"designed according to the rules of the statutes in the sense of continued state control. The Federal Republic of Germany as the founder, represented by the Federal Government, represented by the Federal Ministries, has a continuing significant influence in the sense of a possible implementation of essential decisions. There is a financial and personal dependency, 'ruling through' in the above sense is possible. \" On 9 September 2020, the Federal Ministry of the Interior for Building and Home Affairs announced that the director's position would be based on the judgment of the Berlin-Brandenburg State Labor Courtis rewritten.\n\nParagraph 5: Reiz (ad Theophilum, pp. 1234, 1236) thinks that Enantiophanes wrote before the composition of the Basilica, and marks his name with an asterisk as an ascertained contemporary of Justinian. In Basil. iii. p. 318 Enantiophanes calls Stephanus his master; but this is by no means conclusive. Assemanni, misled by Papadopoli, thinks that the Stephanus here meant lived under Alexius Comnenus, and was not the Stephanus who was one of the compilers of Justinian's Digest. The contemporary of Justinian, however, was undoubtedly the person intended; but Stephanus was one of those early Graeco-Roman jurists who, like Domninus, Patricius, and Cyrillus, are thought by Zachariae (Anecdota, p. viii.) to have been called by subsequent jurists masters or teachers in a general sense. (Compare Basil. 11. tit. i. s. 67, sch. ed. Heimbach, i. p. 646.) Zachariae places Enantiophanes among the jurists who lived before the time of Basileius Macedo (Hist. Jur. Gr. Rom. Deiius, § 20. 1, 2.) That he lived before the formation of the present text of the Basilica, appears from his being several times named in the text itself, as in iii. p. 258, where he cites Theophilus ; ii. p. 560, where he cites the Code of Justinian ; i. 99, where he cites the Novells of Justinian. According to the Scholium on the Basilica (ii. p. 548, ed. Heimbach), he seems to have written notes upon the Digest. That he was alive after the death of Justinian appears from Basil. iii. p. 230 (ed. Heimbach), where he cites a Novell of Justin. On the other hand, Assemanni thinks that he wrote after the composition of the Basilica, which, in the Scholium, Basil. i. p. 262, he appears to cite; but it is very likely that here, as in many other places, that which was originally a citation from the Digest has been subsequently changed for convenience into a reference to the Basilica. In Basil. iii. p. 440, he cites Gregorius Doxapater, whom Pohl (followed by Zachariae), on the supposed authority of Montfaucon, places in the first half of the 12th century; but we have shown that there is no ground for identifying Gregorius Doxapater with the Doxapater mentioned by Montfaucon. An eminent jurist of the time of Justinian is frequently cited in the Basilica, and in the Scholia on that work by the appellation of the Anonymous. This writer composed an Index or abridgment of the Novells of Justinian, and was the author of Paratitla (a comparison of parallel passages) in the Digest. To this work the treatise on apparently discordant passages would form a natural sequel; and Mortrenil (Histoire du Droil Byzantin, i. p. 296) makes it probable that Enantiophanes and the Anonymous were the same persons; for in Basil. vi. p. 251 Schol., a passage is ascribed to Enantiophanes, which, in Basil. vi. p. 260, Schol., is attributed to the Anonymous. Biener (Geschichte der Novellen Justinians, p. 56) threw out the conjecture, that the Anonymous was no other than Julianus, the author of the Latin Epitome of the Novells; and Zachariae (Anecdota, p. 204–7) attempts to establish this conjecture. Mortreuil seems disposed to identify the three. In order to facilitate investigation, we subjoin a list (formed from Reiz and Fabricius) of passages in the Basilica where the name of Enantiophanes occurs: Basil. i. pp. 70, 99, 100, 109, 260, 408, 262, 265, 266, ii. pp. 540, 560, 609, 610, 628, iii. pp. 43, 170, 258, 318, 393, 394, 412, v. p. 726, vi. 250, 251, 260, vii. 496, 499, 565, 640, 641. (Heimbach, de Basil. Orig. pp. 76–79.)\n\nParagraph 6: Through reading Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren, readers can discover Emerson's emotions that convey his transcendentalist attitude. At the time, transcendentalism was a growing movement that focused on pinpointing the discrepancies of society. This led to a growing desire to get involved in politics and the actions of the American government. Primary topics for those recognized with the Transcendentalist Movement included the War with Mexico, the treatment of Native Americans, and the ongoing practice of slavery. Emerson saw the Cherokee as innocent people still left untainted by the \"atrocities\" of society. He is trying to convince President Van Buren of their growing civility, and show support for the Cherokee tribe. However, Emerson explains in his essay, Nature, that once one is born and bred in nature, they will never forget its influence. Emerson believed that all mankind was ultimately good. Therefore, he begins to question whether he could say the same about the American government. He proclaims,\"it is the chirping of grasshoppers beside the immortal question whether justice shall be done by the race of civilized, to the race of savage man; whether all the attributes of reason, of civility, of justice, and even of mercy, shall be put off by the American people, and so vast an outrage upon the Cherokee nation, and upon human nature, shall be consummated (Emerson, 1270-1271).\" He questions how a nation that calls itself \"civilized\" is capable of sending thousands of Indians away from their native land just so the Americans can have the land for themselves. He continues, \"On the broaching of this question, a general expression of despondency,-of disbelief that any good will accrue from a remonstrance on an act of fraud and robbery-appeared in those men to whom we naturally turn for aid and counsel. Will the American Government steal? Will it lie? Will it kill?-we ask triumphantly. Our wise men shake their heads dubiously (Emerson, 1271).\" Emerson proposed the question as to whether or not the American government has morals and, if so, he is challenging its ethics and core values. This letter was meant to burden the conscience of Van Buren and question whether the president’s actions would represent the will of the American people. Not only was Martin Van Buren challenged to consider how his actions would affect the Cherokee Indians, he was also made aware that such an action might make the entire nation start to question the morality of the government. In the words of Emerson scholar Kenneth Sacks, \"Especially important is an argument that immorality toward any member of the community is immorality toward all: 'a crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees of a country'\".\n\nParagraph 7: The August 29, 2014 Super Viernes professional wrestling show hosted the finals of Mexican wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) annual Universal Championship tournament. In previous weeks Último Guerrero and La Sombra had both won their qualifying round to head to the finals of the tournament. Guerrero had previously won the 2009 Universal Championship tournament and La Sombra had won the 2011 tournament, which meant that for the first time ever there would be a two time winner of the Universal Championship. Both Guerrero and La Sombra had been involved in separate storylines up until this point, Último Guerrero continued his several-years long feud with Atlantis while La Sombra had been part of an emerging group known as Los Ingobernables that had headlined a large number of CMLL shows in 2014. The tournament finals was the only tournament match to be contested under \"best two-out-of-three falls\" rules and saw Último Guerrero win the first and third fall to become the first ever two time Universal Championship tournament winner. In the second to last match of the night long time rivals Negro Casas and Rush found themselves on opposite sides of a Six-man tag team match as they clashed to carry on the feud that had seen Negro Casas shaved bald less than a month ago and Casas and partner Shocker defeat Rush and La Máscara to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. Another issue in the semi-main event was the ongoing storyline between former partners Rey Escorpión and Dragón Rojo Jr. that began when Dragón Rojo Jr. decided to leave the Rey Escorpión led Los Revolucionarios del Terror (\"The Revolutionaries of Terror\") a few months prior. The betrayal led to an ongoing rivalry between the two, a rivalry that had already seen Dragón Rojo Jr. successfully defend the CMLL World Middleweight Championship against his Rey Escorpión on the August 8 Super Viernes show. Casas and Rey Escorpión were joined by Niebla Roja as they took on Rush, Dragón Rojo Jr. and Atlantis, defeating the trio by disqualification when Rush caused his team to lose after a low blow on Casas. The fourth match of the night was used to showcase a quickly developing feud between Rey Cometa and Cavernario, a storyline that would lead to a featured match on the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show only a few weeks later. Rey Cometa, Máscara Dorada and Valiente took on the group known as La Peste Negra (\"The Black Plague\"; Cavernario, El Felino and Mr. Niebla). In the third and deciding fall La Peste Negra's disregard for the rules got the team disqualified for excessive violence on Rey Cometa.\n\nParagraph 8: Performers varied from venue to venue, but a handful remained consistent throughout the majority of the readings.

Erase Me is a full-album experience that feels like a bridge between Underoath's previous four records and vocalist Spencer Chamberlain's electronic rock project Sleepwave. Christopher Dudley's synth-work and programming, along with pulsing bass-lines from Grant Brandell result in the most industrialized version of the band yet. However, the stars of the show are Chamberlain and drummer Aaron Gillespie, whose kit work is as impressive as ever ('On My Teeth' will make fans smile). Their vocal trade-offs skew fairly heavily toward Chamberlain's dexterous pipes, which makes sense in keeping with the darker sound. It doesn't always work, most notably in sections of 'Rapture' and 'I Give Up' that feel a bit out of sorts\" Metal Injection wrote of the album that \"'Rapture' might not be an immediate hit with Underoath fans, and there are a couple of other tracks with the same flavor as such, ('Wake Me'), but there are plenty of other tracks to chew on. 'On My Teeth' is a great mix of their hectic side while still being able to bring it down with a clean and melodic chorus. 'Hold Your Breath' will also persuade you to circle a pit as soon as it drops. And at the same time, a song like 'ihateit' has also been stuck in my head for several days now. Again, an album like this could have been released immediately after Ø and it wouldn't have appeared to have been a departure.\" MetalSucks gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and explained \"It's not a boring listen per se, but it's not fresh. A significant portion of the material here feels like something bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Norma Jean beat into the ground circa in the late '00s and early '10s. While I'm sure some fans will be content with that, if you're anything like me you'll find yourself wondering whether or not any of this was worth your time.\" Sputnik Music gave the album 3 out of 5 further elaborating \"Unintentionally or otherwise, Spencer's Music Feeds interview divided the band's creatives into himself and Aaron, the pop songwriters, while Tim and Chris bring the heavy and experimental material. It's probably not that black-and-white in reality, but it's an easy narrative I think many will adopt in Erase Me's wake, looking for ways to shift and pinpoint the blame on why the album is a relative disappointment.\"\n\nParagraph 10: The scherzo movement of the quartet, the third movement (allegretto), uses a Russian theme also used by Modest Mussorgsky in Boris Godunov, by Anton Arensky in his String Quartet No. 2 in A Minor, by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in 'Orchestral Interlude: The Battle of Poltava' from Mazeppa, and by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his 6 Morceaux for Piano Duet, Op. 11. The original song, \"Glory to the Sun\", was collected by Nikolay Lvov and Jan Prac; sheet music was published in 1790 (second edition 1806), verses in the 1770s. However, Beethoven used it in an ungentle way. According to Kerman, \"It sounds as though Count Razumovsky had been tactless enough to hand Beethoven the tune, and Beethoven is pile-driving it into the ground by way of revenge.\" In an extremely unusual example of melodic setting prior to the 20th century, portions of the tune with strong tonic harmonic leanings are harmonized with the dominant, and vice versa; the harmonic clash is harsh, and many listeners have found this portion of the quartet to be quite amusing, especially as contrasted with the prosaic, almost \"exercise-book\" counterpoint which precedes it (another example of Beethoven parodying a student counterpoint exercise can be found in the scherzo of the Quartet No. 10, opus 74)."}

He was the first to set a timed lap early on with six minutes remaining in the session. The top speed of his car down the long back straight was only 314 km/h as he hit the 7th gear rev-limiter meaning that Mercedes cars didn't have the highest top speed but rather made up time through a better acceleration through the f-duct system as he was one of the quickest past the start/finish line speed trap. Rosberg posted a 1:35.121 which was by far the fastest time of the weekend so far. Teammate Michael Schumacher was half a second slower than Rosberg, as was Hamilton, further highlighting how good Rosberg's lap was. Schumacher on his radio was told Rosberg's lap time and in reply said \"not bad\". After seeing Webber more than a second off his fastest lap time, Rosberg got out of his car with just under two minutes still left in the session. After confidently leaving his Mercedes, Rosberg watched everyone else fall short of his time and claimed his first pole position of his 111-race career. Following him was Hamilton half a second off (who lined up 7th on the grid after a gearbox change incurred a 5 place grid penalty) and teammate Schumacher in 3rd. Kamui Kobayashi qualified 4th fastest in his best ever qualifying result of his Formula One career to date. His previous best qualifying result was 7th in his home race at the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix. Räikkönen, like in Malaysia, posted the 5th quickest time while Button was more than a second from Rosberg's time in 6th. Webber, in the Red Bull, was 7th while Pérez, in the second Sauber, was an impressive 8th with - like his teammate -  his best ever qualifying result in his Formula One career to date. His previous best was a 9th in the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix. Alonso, like Räikkönen, was in the same position as the Malaysia qualifying session and lined up on the grid in 9th, while Grojean in the second Lotus didn't complete a timed lap and hence was 10th. In another milestone, it was the first time that both Saubers had qualified in the top 10 since the 2009 season when team were known as BMW Sauber.\n\nParagraph 3: The Four Spirits sculpture was unveiled at Kelly Ingram Park on September, 2013 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Crafted in Berkeley, California by Birmingham-born sculptor Elizabeth MacQueen and designed as a memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing (which occurred on September 15, 1963), it depicts the four girls in preparation for the church sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church in the moments immediately before the explosion. The youngest girl killed in the explosion (Carol Denise McNair) is depicted releasing six doves into the air as she stands tiptoed and barefooted upon a bench as another barefooted girl (Addie Mae Collins) is depicted kneeling upon the bench, affixing a dress sash to McNair; a third girl (Cynthia Wesley) is depicted sitting upon the bench alongside McNair and Collins with a book in her lap.  The book depicts the refrain of William Butler Yeats poem \"The Stolen Child\". The fourth girl (Carole Robertson) is depicted standing and smiling as she motions the other three girls to attend their church sermon. At the base of the sculpture is an inscription of the name of the sermon the four girls were to attend prior to the bombing—\"A Love that Forgives.\" Oval photographs and brief biographies of the four girls killed in the explosion, the most seriously injured survivor (Sarah Collins), and the two teenage boys shot to death later that day also adorn the base of the sculpture.\n\nParagraph 4: ...the market potential for a four-wheel drive recreational vehicle was an unknown quantity in the early 1950s. The only such vehicle offered in the post-war period was the Willys Jeep, a version of the military jeep produced for World War II. It was a flat-sided bare-bones product, and American military personnel learned to appreciate its ability to maneuver over rough terrain. Sales volume was very low. In early 1958, we were directed to develop a concept proposal to enter this small market of that time. So help me, Mr. Reese, manager of engineering, said 'design something to replace the horse.' There was no product definition to use as a guide. It was even proposed to use the defunct Henry J body tooling. Compound body surfaces were considered too far out for this type of vehicle. The military jeep was thought to have the correct appearance. Our design sketches with the flat-side, no-contour look never excited the executive committee. The program began to die. One night while sitting at our kitchen table (full of frustration and desperation), I dashed off this rough sketch on a piece of scrap mat board. It had contoured sides and was designed for plastic tooling. The next morning it was shown to a committee member. He reviewed it with controlled enthusiasm, but revived interest in the program. We were off and running. Goodyear produced many plastic parts for WWII and had formed a large plastic engineering group. We entered a program with them, a scale model was vacuum formed to simulate body assembly. This model received executive approval for appearance. By July 1959, Goodyear completed their costing, and because of the high costs, the plastic program was cancelled. By this time, the contoured design met with executive approval and a decision was made to convert the body design to steel. Starting in late July 1959, a full-sized clay model was completed, and in November 1959, it was approved. Looking back, it was a remarkable program with fast-paced engineering and manufacturing developments. The total development time of 24 months was an heroic achievement considering the concept was unique and no in-house engine or manufacturing was available or even considered when the program started.\n\nParagraph 5: The case arose because a Stanford employee, who was under obligation to assign certain inventions to Stanford, if Stanford was required by law or contract to own them, was sent by Stanford faculty to work at a biotech company to learn PCR, a proprietary technique, and signed an agreement with that company agreeing to assign inventions made arising from his access to PCR to the company. The company was later purchased by Roche.  Stanford filed patents on work the employee did at the company after he returned to Stanford, and the company (and later Roche) introduced products based on the work the Stanford employee (and others) did at the company. When Stanford sued Roche for infringing its patents, Roche countered that it had an ownership interest in the patents due to the agreement that the Stanford employee had signed with the company. Among the arguments Stanford made at the District, Federal Circuit, and Supreme Court levels, was one that stated that the Bayh–Dole Act gave grant recipients a \"right of second refusal\" subject to the Government's right of first refusal, based on the following language of the statute: \"If a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations promulgated hereunder.\"\n\nParagraph 6: The TLS facility interrogates the transponders of all aircraft within . After receiving a response, TLS determines the aircraft's location using three sets of antenna arrays: one for horizontal position using monopulse techniques, the other for vertical monopulse and a third for trilateration. TLS then calculates the position of all aircraft using the transponder replies and converts that into real-time guidance for an aircraft cleared for approach based on its position relative to the desired approach path.  The position tracks for all aircraft in the TLS service volume are displayed on an ATC monitor similar to a secondary surveillance radar but with an increased update rate and higher accuracy. For an aircraft conducting an instrument approach, the TLS will transmit horizontal and vertical guidance signals to the ILS receiver and cockpit avionics that are identical to those of an ILS. The signals will thus appear to emanate from fixed locations where ILS antennas are typically installed. However, TLS guidance is not a function of antenna location - the TLS can provide guidance from \"virtual emanation points\" that may be anywhere as required by an instrument approach procedure but are configured in the TLS software. This allows the TLS to support multiple approach procedures at a given airport, including steeper glide slope angles for rotary-wing aircraft or increased obstacle clearance, with a single complete system installed adjacent to runway threshold. The TLS will also produce marker beacon-like audio to indicate distance from the runway, but without the requirement for physical equipment. All the pilot has to do is follow the same ATC protocols required for a conventional ILS approach.  Any aircraft conducting a PAR-type approach can be viewed on the TLS PAR format console displaying azimuth and elevation. Up to four different aircraft may be viewed independently on four separate consoles to assist PAR controllers with talk-down approaches.\n\nParagraph 7: On December 8, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his match against Colt Cabana. Lacey threw a handful of powder in Cabana's face when he had Jacobs in a submission causing a disqualification. Daizee Haze fought with Lacey until Jacobs speared Haze hard. Brent Albright ran down to the ring and, he held Cabana down while Lacey stomped him the groin. Whitmer then ran down to make the save. The next night, December 9, Lacey accompanied Jacobs to the ring as part the main event, pitting Delirious, Whitmer (accompanied by Haze), Cabana, and McGuinness against Bryan Danielson, Jacobs, Rave and Shingo. During the match, Whitmer inadvertently hit Lacey with a railroad spike. On January 27, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his Last Man Standing Match against Whitmer which Jacobs won thanks to Albright. Later in the evening, Albright and Lacey lost to Cabana and Sara Del Rey who substituted for an injured Haze. But post-match, Haze attacked Lacey. On February 23, Lacey accompanied Jacobs and Albright to the ring for their losing effort against Nigel McGuinness and Cabana. Later in the evening Lacey defeated Haze after Jacobs interfered and speared Haze. The following night, February 24, Lacey accompanied Jacobs for his \"Windy City Death match\" against Cabana. Early on Lacey tried to interfere, but Haze ran out and brawled with her to the back. Later in the match Lacey returned to attack Cabana again, only to be taken out before he laid out Jacobs and put Lacey face down on top of him as he pinned him. On March 30, Lacey and Jacobs defeated Whitmer and Haze. Post-match Lacey said Jacobs finally won her over and she gave him a hug to reward him for a job well done. The following night, March 31, Lacey accompanied Jacobs to the ring for his Steel Cage Match against Whitmer (accompanied by Haze). During the match Lacey tried to interfere but was taken out by a tombstone pile-driver from Whitmer. Jacobs won the match, winning their feud despite injuring himself in the match.\n\nParagraph 8: In August 2006, Milian sued the co-writer and producer of \"Dip It Low\", Poli Paul, claiming that Paul \"very definitively\" assured her that \"there were no samples whatsoever in [...] 'Dip It Low'\". The issue had arisen in February 2005, when Thomas Turino, Larry Crook, and Dan Dickey sued Milian over the song, claiming that it contained a sample from a track they released in 1983 called \"La Sirena\". The lawsuit claimed that Paul heard the album while in a record store, liked the tune and sampled twelve seconds of it for \"Dip It Low\". These twelve seconds are repeated in a loop throughout the entire song. This suit was successful and the plaintiffs recovered over a million dollars (after lawyer expenses) divided 40% for Turino (the composer of the theme of the song), and 30% each for Dickey and Crook.  Milian claimed that she had to spend more than $300,000 defending herself in the case, which she settled in 2006, and wanted $300,000 plus damages from Paul and his associate, Spencer Cowlings Entertainment. In November 2006, Paul countersued the Island Def Jam Music Group and its parent company, Universal Music Group. Paul alleged that Island Def Jam was \"negligent in its obligation to obtain clearance and proper licensing for any copyrighted material\" used on the album. In February 2006, a superior court judge ruled that Paul's attorneys had failed to file a sworn declaration in the given period of time, but allowed them to file an amended complaint. Paul's lawyers amended the countersuit and added Milian as a defendant, saying that she was also negligent and that she should compensate him for money he spent in the copyright action. In June 2006, Universal Music Group filed a breach-of-contract suit against Milian and Paul. The record label claimed it was forced to pay attorney fees as a result of the litigation between Milian and Paul. The suit also said that Paul owes the company attorneys' fees from an earlier federal court case involving \"Dip It Low\".\n\nParagraph 9: Charles Batchelor was born on Christmas Day, 1845, and raised in Manchester, England. He was a draftsman and machinist, and later on in his life he was Thomas Alva Edison's friend and right-hand man.  In 1870, while working for a textile equipment manufacturer, he was sent to the United States to install some equipment in a Newark, New Jersey textile factory. At this time Thomas Edison's main laboratory and shop were also located in Newark where the two met. By the end of October 1871 Batchelor was working at Edison's American Telegraph Works, and by the summer of 1873 was assisting Edison in inventing.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1930 Womersely left Imperial College to take up a position as a junior research officer at the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Institute), Manchester. There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett, the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control. While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques.  As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches. In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations. In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing.  In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17). This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting sample inspection methods to British industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the US for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly. Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947. However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950. Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned, although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances. He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer. The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer."}

It states that prior to this period, farms were the dominant feature in the area, but with the construction of new homes and the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, there was a significant rise in population and urban development. These changes initially occurred more prominently on the East Shore before spreading inland towards the end of the decade. It also highlights demographic differences between the Mid-Island and East Shore areas, with the Mid-Island experiencing a larger Jewish transplant population, while the East Shore saw a heavy influx of Italian-Americans. However, it notes that these demographic differences are not present in the area today, with Italian-Americans now predominating the Mid-Island region.", "Teague grew up watching Gloucester and eventually joined the team at the age of 18. He played for Gloucester for most of his career, but also had short stints at Cardiff RFC and Stroud RFC. He played a total of 291 games for Gloucester and won the John Player Cup in 1982. He also had a successful season in 1981-82, scoring 21 tries, which remains a record for the club. Teague was sent off three times, including twice against Bath.

Giving three out of four bones, the VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever highlighted the parodies in the film, and noted that \"Parents will be [as] equally entertained [as children] by the level of humor and fast-paced action\". Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying the film was \"[e]pisodic,\" but praised the voice cast, songs and \"funny business\". TV Guide called the film a \"firecracker\", citing the film's many jokes. The book Videos for Kids: The Essential, Indispensable Parent's Guide to Children's Movies on Video praised the \"tongue-in-cheek humor\" and celebrity caricatures but issued warning to parents, stating that the film may not be appropriate for \"children too young to identify satire\" because the characters in the film \"are rude and combative\" and may not be positive role models. Videos for Kids still concluded that the film \"should provide an enjoyable viewing experience for the whole family\". Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times said that the format of a direct-video film was \"unusual\", but that some parts of the film were \"hilarious\", especially the scenes which make fun of Walt Disney World. Since its release, How I Spent My Vacation has been rated as one of the \"Top 20 (U.S.-Produced) Direct-to-Video Animated Films\" by The Animated Movie Guide.\n\nParagraph 2: Totenkopf was initially held in reserve during the Battle of France and invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940. The division was committed on 16 May to the front in Belgium. Later, it was decided that Totenkopf would reinforce the breakthrough of Erwin Rommel’s 7th Panzer Division in the Cambrai area. Reaching the Bazuel area straddling both sides of the river it arrived on the front on 19 May, facing elements of the French 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, 5th North African Infantry Division, and 9th Motorized Division. Totenkopf suffered 16 dead and 53 wounded while killing 200 Moroccan soldiers in its first day in action. In its first major battle it captured the town of Catillon-sur-Sambre and its associated canal in fierce house-to-house fighting, blocking the exits of the town and trapping the Moroccan force in the center around the market square, eventually captured thousands of remaining troops. Soldiers from Totenkopf executed many captured Moroccans, due to Arabs being considered \"racially inferior\". On the morning of the next day, May 20 it contained a major Moroccan counter attack near Ribeauville, driving it back with its own counter attack, before crossing the Selle river and linking up with Rommel’s division in the outskirts of Cambrai. Overall in the actions around the Cambrai/Sambre area the division captured 16,000 troops.\n\nParagraph 3: He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1872 to the Forty-third Congress.  He has been incorrectly labeled as a slave holder on this page who got incorrect information from an article written by the Washington Post, listing all Slave Holder officials, but unfortunately, that paper is a biased instrument of a group of people trying their hardest to disparage almost every government official who had a part in the first 120 years of this young United States.  There is no documentation to support ownership of slaves by Bigby and frankly his life was busy with education in law and then eventually becoming a judge and then a Republican Congressman for Georgia.  He openly spoke of the common behavior of those in Georgia and the poor reflection they give but makes sure to let the Speaker of the House and its members know that the Republican Party in Georgia sees the issues and is obviously afraid of being lumped in with their views and behavior. Rigby closes his speech with these heart felt feelings about the state he loves but the conflict it presents, \"The murmurs of the stream which but a few years ago rolled along in silent grandeur is not hushed by the music of the buys factory. Under the influence of their beneficent sway all the noble impulses of a generous humanity are called into action, and every one, feeling that feedom is his inheritance, strives for a higher place in the scale of an honorable manhood. In this contest the colored man is not indifferent to the claims which society has upon him, nor does he underestimate the boon which the friends of freedom have bestowed upon him. Right nobly has he acted his part since the manacles of slavery were stricken from his limbs, and he sent forth upon the mission of life with all the rights of a citizen and an equal before the law.  Nor is his mind vailed in the night of darkness which the enemies of human liberty would fain have the country believe. It is true, that in the arts and sciences, in polite literature and classic lore, the colored voting population have not yet made much advancement (only seven years has passed since emancipation is why); but they are keenly alive to all duties of good citizenship and fairly comprehend the principles of government upon which the substantial prosperity of the nation depends.  Nor has he, as a general thing, been immodest in his aspirations for positions of honor and trust. In many instances he has been compelled to seek position because there is no one of the more favored race (sarcasm) who would consent to become the exponent of the principles of his party.  It is not strange, therefore, that he has been found in conventions which made organic law, and in Legislatures which enacted the needful laws for the government of the country.  That he is worthy of the elective franchise is abundantly shown by the care and fidelity with which he has exercised it.  And that party (Republican) which conferred it upon him, and which would secure him in its peaceful enjoyment, deserves to live forever in the memory of a grateful people (for what they had done for the country as slaves).\"\n\nParagraph 4: Many of his works have been bought for public galleries, and his monuments are to be found in the public squares of the chief cities of France. At Reims there is his bronze statue of Colbert, at Dijon his Rameau monument. The Musée du Luxembourg has his Anacreon (1852), Faucheur (1855), and the marble bust of Mgr Darboy; the Versailles Museum the portrait of Thiers; the Sorbonne Library the marble bust of Victor le Clerc, doyen de la faculté des lettres. Other works of his are at Trinity Church, Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, and the church of St Clotilde, Paris. The Musée d'Orsay in Paris hosts Les Gracques (1853).\n\nParagraph 5: Like all of Staten Island except for the North Shore, farms dominated the Mid-Island region until the 1960s, when new home construction began to rise sharply.  The opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 did much to stimulate this construction, but the effects of this phenomenon were first seen most profoundly on the East Shore, not spreading inland until nearly the end of the decade.  In addition to starting somewhat later, the population boom experienced in Mid-Island also exhibited some important demographic differences from that which took place to the east, as in Mid-Island Jewish transplants (from Queens as well as Brooklyn) tended to predominate, in contrast to the heavily Italian-American influx experienced on the East Shore.  These demographic differences are not present today with mostly Italian-Americans dominating the area.\n\nParagraph 6: The type designation used to specify Units is made up of a unit letter(s) indicator (from the table below), followed by a dash, a unit number, followed by a slash, and 1-3 letters specifying the equipment it is part of or used with (see Table 1). As with Group type designations, if the Unit is unique and is \"part of\" or \"used with\" only one particular equipment, that equipment may be specified. If the unit is used with multiple different items, the equipment designation should include only the indicators which are common or appropriate. If a unit could be described by multiple indicators, the indicator which best describes the unit's primary function should be used. The exception would be if there exists a unit indicator which can describe the unit's multiple functions (see examples below); if such a multi-function describing unit indicator exists, then it should be used.\n\nParagraph 7:  A stone bridge built 1870. The Buildings of Ireland website describes it as- Single-arch ashlar limestone road bridge, built c.1870, spanning Owenmore River. Abutment supporting soffit, having shallow segmental-arch with stepped elongated voussoirs. Spandrels with sneck-like levellers at voussoirs. Ashlar wing walls, extensive to west side. Equal length parapets with square chamfered coping projecting with angled surface on outer faces of bridge, vertical ends. Appraisal- ‘The ashlar bridge was built in conjunction with an extensive section of road in the latter part of nineteenth century. It has an elegant arch, the span of which is surprisingly large for a rural bridge. The bridge is expertly constructed of carefully cut ashlar and makes a significant contribution to the civil engineering heritage of the county. The Glangevlin website describes it as- This bridge spans the Abhann Mhor. It is located on the Dowra Road in the townland of Garvolt. It is a remarkable one as it is the second largest one in Ireland which has only one eye, the largest spans the Blackwater in Cork. Strangely enough both bridges are reputed to have been built by the same contractor who was supposed to be a McLoughlin from Enniskillen and his three sons. The stones with which the big bridge was built were excavated by manual labour from huge rocks found in Garvolt. The chisels were sharpened in a nearby forge, which was specially erected by the contractor for that purpose. He was so keen that when the bridge was finished there was only one stone left over, and it can be seen nearby up to the present day. After the bridge was completed and the wooden supports were taken away a loud crackling noise was heard which frightened the contractor so much that he was unfit to undertake any other building contracts. A story is told about the forge which remained long after the construction of the bridge was finished. One night a local farmer decided to use it as a byre to \"house\" his calves for the winter. As he was driving them in, clods were thrown from all directions and the farmer cried aloud \"Let me house my calves for the winter and I will never bother you again.\" The clodding stopped and the farmer was granted his wish. Many foreign visitors come to fish in the Abhann Mhor and marvel at the structure of the bridge. Geologists ask many questions about it. A \"turkey's claw\" which is a mark left by sappers who were mapping Ireland is in view on the top of the bridge.\n\nParagraph 8: Bichurin was born in Akulevo to a Russian half-Chuvash priest named Iakov and Russian mother Akulina Stepanova. He studied at a church choir school in Sviiazhsk and later at the Kazan Theological Seminary. He also studied Latin, Greek and French and his abilities were noticed by Archbishop Amvrosij Podobedov of the Russian Orthodox Church.  He taught in Kazan Theological Seminary from 1799 and was anointed a monk in 1800 with the name of Iakinf  or Hyacinth and tonsured, sent to promote Christianity in Beijing, where he spent the next 14 years. The genuine objects of his interest were Chinese history and language. He was forthwith accused of lacking religious zeal, and when he appeared in Irkutsk with his lover Natalia Petrova, some of his students reported him. Complaints over other behaviours considered inappropriate for a priest kept coming.  After several changes in the Russian orthodox mission, the Synod declared Bichurin guilty on 4 September 1823, stripped him of his  archimandrite monk rank and incarcerated him for life in the Valaam Monastery. Here he translated a number of ancient and medieval Chinese manuscripts, which had previously been unknown in Europe. In succeeding decades he published many volumes on Chinese and Mongolian history, geography, religion (including pioneering the study of Chinese Islam), statistics, and agriculture. After the death of Tsar Alexander I and the rise of Nikolai I in 1825, some of Bichurin's friends helped obtain a royal pardon. They also suggested a position for him as an interpreter in the Foreign Ministry. Bichurin then moved to take up a position in St Petersburg. He was elected as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in 1828 and also became an emeritus librarian at the Petersburg Public Library. In the same year he published a \"Description of Tibet in the Modern Age\". He continued to clash with the church authorities and refused promotions. Tsar Nikolai I intervened in 1832 and forbade him from refusing promotions and ordered him to live in the Alexander Nevskii monastery.\n\nParagraph 9: Teague spent his youth in The Shed watching Gloucester. After cutting his teeth with the local All Blues club, Teague joined the Cherry and Whites during the 1978–79 season aged 18 making 4 appearances, his debut coming at Kingsholm against Exeter University on 15 November 1978 in which he scored a try in a comfortable victory. He combined his rugby with his career as a fitter for the local water authority before becoming a builder in what was the amateur era, eventually setting up his own building firm with his brother-in-law. Known to Gloucester fans as 'Iron Mike' he played the majority of his club rugby for his home town club, but also had brief spells at Cardiff RFC for half a season and Stroud RFC with his close friend and Gloucester back row colleague John Gadd, before re-joining Gloucester on both occasions. During the later years of his senior rugby career he played for Moseley, before re-joining Gloucester once again to see out his playing days. Teague made a total of 291 appearances for Gloucester, winning the John Player Cup in 1982 (although they had to share the title with Moseley after a 12–12 draw in extra time – the only time the cup has ever been shared) and the John Smith's Merit Table in the 1985–1986 season. He was twice a runner up with Gloucester in National Courage League 1 (now the Premiership) in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He also played in the 1990 Pilkington Cup final defeat to Bath, scoring a try in both the 26–16 quarter final away win over Nottingham and the 17–12 semi final away win over Northampton that secured Gloucesters spot in the Twickenham showpiece. During the 1981–82 season he scored 21 tries, which remains the club's record for most tries scored by a forward in one season. He was sent off 3 times during his playing career, two of those red cards coming against local rivals Bath. His last game for Gloucester was against Harlequins at Kingsholm at the end of the 1994/95 season aged 34. At the start of the 1995–96 season Teague was appointed to the newly created post of team manager of the Gloucester first team.\n\nParagraph 10: A December 1955 study of 101 patients at the Mississippi State Hospital in Whitfield, Rankin County, Mississippi, found meprobamate useful in the alleviation of \"mental symptoms\": 3% of patients made a complete recovery, 29% were greatly improved, 50% were somewhat better, while 18% realized little change. Self-destructive patients became cooperative and calmer, and experienced a resumption of logical thinking. In 50% of the cases, relaxation brought about more favorable sleep habits. Following the trial, hydrotherapy and all types of shock treatment were subsequently halted. Meprobamate was found to help in the treatment of alcoholics by 1956. By 1957, over 36 million prescriptions had been filled for meprobamate in the US alone, a billion pills had been manufactured, and it accounted for fully a third of all prescriptions written. Berger, clinical director of Wallace Laboratories, described it as a relaxant of the central nervous system, whereas other tranquilizers suppressed it. A University of Michigan study found that meprobamate affected driving skills. Though patients reported being able to relax more easily, meprobamate did not completely alleviate their tense feelings. The disclosures came at a special scientific meeting at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York City, at which Aldous Huxley addressed an evening session. He predicted the development of many chemicals \"capable of changing the quality of human consciousness\", in the next few years."}

The original members were Equitant Ifernain (guitars, bass, lyrics) and Shaftiel (guitars, vocals). After recording two demos and releasing an EP, they were joined by Proscriptor McGovern (Russ R. Givens – drums, vocals, lyrics), David Athron Mystica (guitars), and Black Massith (keyboards, synth, sequencing). After releasing their first album, Barathrum: V.I.T.R.I.O.L., in 1993, Absu narrowed their line-up to a three piece when David Athron Mystica and Black Massith left. For live performances, they recruited the help of Mezzadurus (from the Philadelphia black/thrash band Bloodstorm) and recorded as a three piece with Shaftiel and Proscriptor sharing vocal duties and Proscriptor taking over keyboard and synth duties as well. The band stayed with this line-up for some time. With their second album, The Sun of Tiphareth (1995), the band explored Sumerian, Mesopotamian, and Celtic mythology. The band's third album, The Third Storm of Cythraul (1997), drew inspiration mainly from Celtic mythology, and continued their intellectual approach. Over the next four years, Equitant and Proscriptor worked with the ambient group Equimanthorn and Absu's sole release was the EP In the Eyes of Ioldánach (1998).\n\nParagraph 2: On September 24, 2013, the band released their fifth album Negativity. The album was produced by Steve Berlin and displayed a slicker polished sound than previous releases, with McCauley revealing that Berlin changed the structure of every song he took to the sessions and \"doesn’t settle for any of that kind of raggedy, kind of charming, first take kind of sound.\" Crowell added that \"Steve had a really large hand in shaping this album\" and that \"there is a fair bit of layering on the album, but I like it as the keyboardist, because there is more keyboards.\" The album was preceded by the Ian O'Neil song \"The Dream's In The Ditch,\" which was originally intended for his Dirt Naps project. The band performed the song on Conan on September 25, 2013. Many of McCauley's songs on the album were written on piano instead of guitar and were put together while on vacation in Namibia and Johannesburg in 2012. The band demoed close to 30 songs for the album, with Berlin picking 12 to work on including a duet with pop singer Vanessa Carlton on \"In Our Time.\" McCauley later married Carlton in December 2013 in a ceremony officiated by former Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The album was influenced by recent events in McCauley's life including his father, a Democrat who represented Providence, pleading guilty to filing false tax returns and conspiring to defraud the federal government of more than $500,000 resulting in a 27-month prison sentence and a $10,000 fine, the death of his uncle, his wedding engagement to Nikki Kvarnes of Nashville band Those Darlins collapsing due to his drug use and drinking and subsequently getting clean from drugs. The song \"Mr. Sticks\" is about family struggles with the title being his father's childhood nickname and \"Pot Of Gold\" is a \"stream of consciousness recollection of what went through my head and what kinds of misadventures I got myself into when I was doing crack.\" Throughout 2013, O'Neil and the Ryan brothers played several shows with Ravi Shavi frontman Rafay Rashid in their new side project Happiness.\n\nParagraph 3: David returns the following month after hearing that Pat is ill. He is later stunned to discover that Pat is in fact dying of pancreatic cancer. They argue and David resolves to leave, but Carol persuades him to stay. Derek arrives and provokes David, and a fight breaks out. David tells Derek he is staying and returns to Pat, where he forgives her for her past mistakes and she dies in his arms. David decides to stay in Walford to plan Pat's funeral. He flirts with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and goes to have sex with her, but has second thoughts and nothing happens. David then declares his love for Carol. She reciprocates, and the pair reunite. David tries to settle his differences with Derek, but Derek threatens him. Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) suggests to David that they should team up to bring Derek down and get him arrested. David agrees after Derek upsets Carol. They attempt to set Derek up by having Michael plant stolen goods in Derek's home. However, Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael blames the entire scheme on David. When David learns of this he begs Carol to leave with him. Carol agrees, but after Pat's funeral, David is confronted by Derek and his brothers Jack (Scott Maslen) and Max (Jake Wood). Derek threatens to kill David, but Jack and Max restrain Derek as they let David go. As he returns to his car to meet Carol, he sees her saying an emotional goodbye to Bianca and her family, so realises her family needs her and leaves without her. David sends a letter to Carol but it is intercepted and locked away by Derek. After Derek dies, the letter is found and Carol tries to contact David but discovers his phone number has been disconnected.\n\nParagraph 4: The earliest purely Irish statute on the kindred subjects of nuisances to navigation and fisheries was the 5 Ed 4 c 6; but it merely referred to foreign vessels visiting the Irish coasts for the purposes of fishing, and had no permanent effect on the subjects' common law right. The next Irish statute, however, was of much more importance; and its provisions seemed to be still in force in 1863, and certainly had not expressly been repealed. This Act, the Inland Navigation Act 1537 (28 Hen 8 c 22) (Ir),1 vol of st p. 161, after reciting the great injury done to the navigation or traffic of boats, cottes, wherries, and other vessels on the royal rivers, Barrow, Nore, Suir, and those to and from Waterford, Kilkenny, Ross, Clonmel, and other places in the counties of Kildare, Catherlogh, (Carlow) Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Tipperary, by the erection of weirs and other obstacles, and through which the salmon fry were destroyed, enacted that it shall be lawful for any person, with the aid of the sheriff of the county, to prostrate all such weirs, and to make a convenient gap through every mill pond; it also imposed heavy penalties on persons resisting this summary process of removing obstructions to navigation. The Act, \"so far as relates to destroying salmon fry,\" was repealed by the Fisheries (Ireland) Act 1842 (5 & 6 Vict c 106), the first Act of a code of Irish fishery laws; but there was not the least reason to doubt that it was in full force in all other respects in 1863. Indeed, as to the abatement of those public nuisances in the various navigable waters enumerated, it only confirmed and strengthened the common law, which permits everyone interested in the matter, and particularly required all justices and sheriffs, summarily, and of their own motion, without tedious formal process and authority from courts of law, to abate all nuisances prejudicial to the public interests, especially those so highly favoured as the interests of navigation, commerce, and fishing. Under this Act rights were enjoyed of towage on the banks of the rivers referred to in it; and there seems, therefore, no reason to doubt that the opinion attributed to Mr. M'Mahon MP, that this statute was still law and might at any time be enforced, was correct in 1863. Indeed, it was strengthened by the Inland Navigation Act 1731 (5 Geo 2 c 11) (Ir), which, after reciting the Inland Navigation Act 1537, imposed very heavy penalties-£50 for the first offence, £100 for the second, on the re-erection of any weirs prostrated under the authority of the Inland Navigation Act 1537, just recited. The Inland Navigation Act 1731, was only repealed, as to the third section, which relates to \"fishermen or apprentices fishing in navigable waters.\" There was no provision in the Inland Navigation Act 1537, relating to the destruction of salmon fry. It only recited the fact of the destruction to salmon fry caused by the erection of weirs, etc.; and the repeal of the Act as to this recital seems a mere absurdity; the fact was true, and remained unaltered. The conclusion, therefore, seems clear that both statutes were in full force in 1863 as to the rivers and six counties named in them.\n\nParagraph 5: Arnett (2000) suggested that in adolescents' identity exploration, it is more transient and tentative. (Arnett, 2000). Adolescent dating is recreational in nature, involving group activities. They are still exploring their identity before asking the question \"Given the kind of person I am, what kind of person do I wish to have a partner through life?\" (Arnett, 2000, p. 473). With increasing opportunities to pursue higher education and greater delays in marriage and childbirth (Arnett, 2007), there is now more time, beyond adolescence, for activities and reflections surrounding self-definition and identity development. (Kose, Papouchis & Fireman). When adolescents start to develop the cognitive skill to understand others' feelings and what they are thinking, also known as theory of mind. This helps adolescents to develop their own sense of self and their own way of perceiving the world. It is normal for adolescents to feel personal fable. It is what drives them to develop their own sets of skills to understand others' thoughts and feelings. And this also triggers their ability to seek out their own identity. Arnett (2000) argues that as the age of adulthood had been moved back and the age of becoming an adult is getting older than the past. There is more time for adolescents to explore themselves; he thought of this period of exploration as seemingly a time when perspective-taking skills are being sharpened most dramatically. Personal fable also helps adolescents transition from exploring oneself to seeking extended experimentation, particularly in relationships, during the transition of young adulthood. Elkind though thought that the extension period for identity exploration and less pressure to take on typical adult roles teens are special and invulnerable, but are not feeling on center stage as often felt by the adolescents. (Elkind et al., Lapsley et al., 1989). As an example, some young adults might still have the feeling that they are special inside and invulnerable, but they are less likely to engage in risky behaviors. Some current findings suggest that increases in personal fable ideation are associated with increases in identity and cognitive formal operations, particularly among this young adult age group. Increase in personal fable ideation, feelings of invulnerability, among emerging adults may explain the heightened level of maladaptive behaviors among this group. For example, studies might explore how faulty thinking, particularly personal fable ideation, is related to risk behavior and how interventions can be tailored to address the type of thinking if leading to harmful outcomes for the young adults (18–25 years old). Apparently inconsistent findings might be resolved by improvements in ways of measuring individual differences in the personal fable. Young adults have to be able to cope with an identity crisis, at the same time knowing that personal fable is driving them to risky behaviors. If young adults do not cope with the inner conflicts, they will be likely to involve in risk-behaviors. Current research indicates that the age of emerging adulthood may extend later than previously thought, and the personal fable also appears to persist into emerging adulthood. The persistence of the personal fable could contribute to continued risk-taking behavior even though that age group physically appears to be adult.\n\nParagraph 6: Young Nevare Burvelle is the second son of a second son in the fantasy nation of Gernia. According to Gernian religious practice, firstborn noble sons are heir to the family fortunes, second sons bear swords as soldiers, and third sons are consecrated to the priesthood. Holy Writ specifies other roles as well for subsequent sons.  Nevare will follow his father – newly made a lord by the King – into the Cavalla (cavalry); to the frontier and thence to an advantageous marriage to carry on the Burvelle name. It is a golden future, and Nevare looks forward to it with relish.  From the age of eight, Nevare is schooled daily in math, physics, engineering, and of course combat and military strategy.  With the help of Sergeant Duril, a man who once served under Nevare's father, he learns to live off the land and survive in the harsh plains environment.\n\nParagraph 7: On the other side of the mirror, the Doctor and Romana are reunited with Biroc in a stable, time-locked universe. A repentant Biroc explains they were the slave masters, travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets and subjugate their populations as slaves until the Gundan revolt. The Doctor and Romana are returned to the null space, and are immediately captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realise that the null space is shrinking as the distances between the gateway, the TARDIS, and slaver ship continue to decrease. Rorvik has ordered the crew to try to blast through the mirrors in gateway, believing it to be the way out, but the mirrors resist all attacks.  With the gateway and ship in visible distance of each other, Rorvik resorts to one last attempt to break the mirrors by using the exhaust of the ship's engines against them. While the Doctor warns that this action will be as doomed as the previous ones, Romana regroups with Lazlo and Adric, and together they free the remaining Tharils on the slaver ship. The TARDIS crew flee to the TARDIS as Rorvik initiates his plan—the blast from the engines is reflected by the mirrors back onto the ship, destroying it and its crew.\n\nParagraph 8: The Arctic shrew is most distinctive in its tricolored fur. It is dark brown or black on its back from its head to the base of its tail, while its flanks are a lighter brown, and its underside is lighter still grayish brown. Even its tail is bi-colored, dark brown on the dorsal side, and gradually fading to a lighter brown on the ventral side. The fur is grayer in winter time, and its tricolor is most marked during the winter months from October to June, for the fur is thicker and brighter. Arctic shrews molt twice a year, and the tricolor bands in the fur are less prominent in younger shrews.\n\nParagraph 9: Macapagal Boulevard commences at the intersection with Jose W. Diokno Boulevard, the partner highway in Bay City in the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex in Pasay, where World Trade Center Metro Manila is located. It serves as the logical continuation of Magdalena Jalandoni Street. It heads south across Financial Center consisting of the Philippine National Bank headquarters and the Government Service Insurance System complex, which houses the Philippine Senate. South of the Libertad channel, the boulevard enters Metropolitan Park and the SM Central Business Park, intersecting with Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) before entering the Aseana City development, home of the Department of Foreign Affairs–Office of Consular Affairs Building and Ayala Malls Manila Bay. At Asean Avenue, Macapagal traverses the Entertainment City gaming complex with Solaire Resort & Casino and City of Dreams Manila (formerly Belle Grande Manila) dominating this stretch up to Seaside Boulevard, an extension of NAIA Road. Near the Seaside Boulevard junction are the NAIA Expressway ramps that provide access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport and connect it to the Metro Manila Skyway. The Manila Southwest Integrated Bus Terminal is housed within the former Uniwide Coastal Mall grounds at Seaside Boulevard, while the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange is located few meters south. Macapagal's current southern terminus is Pacific Avenue in Marina Baytown East village in Parañaque, where most traffic turns left towards the Manila–Cavite Expressway. It also has a short extension towards the southern edge of Asiaworld, with the Las Piñas–Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area as the terminating vista.\n\nParagraph 10: During 1968, the college was the scene of protests when students occupied the Crouch End Hill site. Students attending the multi-site college convened to discuss the withdrawal of Student Union funds and resolved to sit-in. During this period they effected a temporary administration of the college, and called for major and consultative review of the art curriculum, supported by sympathetic academic staff and visiting artists. They offered a major critique of the education system at the time. Some of these documents were presented as part of a project called The Hornsey Project. The college was repossessed by local authorities at the beginning of the summer break."}

After receiving training from Satoru Sayama, Sato made his MMA debut in 1994 and showcased his exceptional submission skills by winning over Michael McAuliffe with a calf slicer, a move that had never been used in MMA before. Sato quickly rose through the ranks by winning ten consecutive matches, impressing fans with his aggressive and exciting grappling style. In his fourth match, he achieved victory by submitting his opponent with a flying inverted triangle choke. His fame grew even further after defeating Ricardo Botelho, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, by taking advantage of Botelho's guard usage to attack him with leglocks and submit him with a heel hook.

His father Thomas Boileau had moved to India in 1780 to work at the Supreme Court in Fort William. On his father's side his ancestors were Huguenots from Nîmes. His mother Leah was the daughter of Lt. Col. Ebenezer Jessup from New England. After the death of the father in 1806, the family moved to live in Bury St. Edmunds, England. After studying at the Grammar School, he received a cadetship at the East India Company Military Seminary at Addiscombe in 1819. His brother Henry joined in the next year. He received prizes in mathematics and Hindustani and was gazetted in 1821 and sent for training to Chatham with the Royal Engineers. He reached Calcutta on 22 September 1822 and then on to Kanpur. He was involved in road building at Jabalpur and between Nagpur and Kamptee. In 1826 he became garrison engineer at Agra, designing the St George Church, the jail, a college, and barracks. In 1829 he married Ann, daughter of Captain Hanson, and on the same day, his brother Henry married Ann's sister at St George's Church. Boileau was involved in reconstruction and repair of several Mughal constructions including Jahangir's palace, Fatehpur, and the Taj Mahal. The cost exceeded the estimates and when he wished to leave the East India Company on furlough in 1834, he was asked to pay thirty thousand rupees as outstanding expenses. In 1839, Boileau was assigned to set up a magnetic observatory at Simla after being trained by Professor Humphrey Lloyd of Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 5 March 1840 and later to the Royal Astronomical Society. While at Simla, he also designed the Christ Church and raised funds for its construction. In 1847 he became superintending engineer in the North West Provinces. He then moved to live at Ambala where weekend dinners included flute played by Boileau and piano by his wife Ann. He retired on 4 February 1856 with the rank of Major General, just before the mutiny. The family settled at Notting Hill and he began to work for the wives, widows, and children of soldiers then posted in large numbers in the Crimea. In 1860 he joined the 1st Middlesex Rifle volunteers. Punch magazine depicted a cartoon of him as \"Mr Buffles\" in 1862.

In 1981, Lunny reunited with Moore to form Moving Hearts, along with a young uilleann piper, Davy Spillane. Following the example of the group Horslips, Moving Hearts combined Irish traditional music with rock and roll, and also added elements of jazz to their sound. The group disbanded in 1985. In February 2007, Moving Hearts reunited for a concert in Dublin. In 2008 and 2009, the group performed again in several concerts in Ireland and the United States.\n\nParagraph 5: After being disappointed with the way his material had been treated by the producers of the 1985 film Underworld, which Barker wrote (and which included a scene in which needles burst out of a character's skull), Barker penned the novella The Hellbound Heart (1986) as his first step in directing a film by himself, introducing the Cenobites whom he also referred to as \"sadomasochists from Hell\". The following year, Barker adapted the novella into the first Hellraiser film, introducing the Cenobites to a wider audience. A Cenobite from the novella, described as having his head decorated by a gridwork pattern and jeweled pins, was depicted in the movie as having a similar appearance involving iron nails and operating as the apparent leader of his order of demons. The film credits him as \"Lead Cenobite\", but the make-up crew and production team referred to him as Pinhead, a name that was learned of and adopted by fans. The character is glibly referred to by the name \"Pinhead\" on-screen for the first time in Hellraiser III. The Pinhead name was used in press materials for the films and the various films to follow, as well as tie-in comic books published by Marvel Comics, including a crossover comic with Marshal Law, and a mini-series entitled Pinhead. Clive Barker did not care for the nickname, believing it did not suit the dignity of the villain.\n\nParagraph 6: At this point in the battle, the position of the two armies looked rather odd, since many of the troops on both sides occupied the riverbanks where their opponent had begun the fight. Eugène now made the critical and correct decision to keep pressing the attack and hope that his onrushing columns would scare the main Austrian army across the Mincio once more. He detached the Italian Royal Guard back to Goito in order to secure the bridge, reinforced his eastern flank against Mayer, and, with 13,000 men and 30 guns, advanced north to the village of Valeggio, hoping to cut his enemy's line of retreat. Bellegarde's earlier decision to leave his reserve now paid dividends; Merville's dragoons routed General Perreymond's 1st Hussars and captured the brigade's six guns, only to be counter-attacked, driven back, and see the French reclaim five of those guns. Merville had deployed his men into three lines around Pozzolo: the first two were composed of 2,000 elite grenadiers under General Josef von Stutterheim and the third by the dragoons brigade. They awaited an attack by Eugène, who recalled the Royal Guard from Goito to bolster the two infantry divisions under generals François Jean Baptiste Quesnel and Marie François Rouyer. Eugène finally began a combined arms attack and only heroic resistance by Stutterheim's masses, who lost over 700 men, prevented a breakthrough. Realizing the danger of being outflanked, Merville fell back a mile north of Pozzolo. Eugène's men attacked Merville's division in its new position, but at this time sufficient reinforcements from Bellegarde permitted Merville to stem the French tide and ground the battle to a virtual halt. Renewed French drives took them to the hamlet of Foroni, but nightfall prevented the capture of the crucial Borghetto bridge. Meanwhile, Verdier's men to the north had been barely hanging on, but once the sounds of Eugène's guns were manifest, they became emboldened and managed to defeat the Austrian charges.\n\nParagraph 7: A wigwam, wickiup, wetu (Wampanoag), or wiigiwaam (Ojibwe,  in syllabics: ) is a semi-permanent domed dwelling formerly used by certain Native American tribes and First Nations people and still used for ceremonial events. The term wickiup  is generally used to refer to these kinds of dwellings in the Southwestern United States and Western United States and Northwest Alberta, Canada, while wigwam  is usually applied to these structures in the Northeastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in central Canada. The names can refer to many distinct types of Indigenous structures regardless of location or cultural group. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Native Plains tipi, which has a different construction, structure, and use.\n\nParagraph 8: The second single was nevertheless a huge country/pop success and later that year, Colter launched a nationwide tour as part of Waylon Jennings' program at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. In 1976 Colter released her second and third Capitol studio albums, Jessi and Diamond in the Rough. Both albums were as successful as Colter's 1975 album, both debuting at No. 4 on the Top Country Albums chart. The lead single from her Jessi album, \"It's Morning (And I Still Love You)\" was a Top 15 country hit in 1976 on the country charts. Her second album that year, Diamond in the Rough produced only one charting single, \"I Thought I Heard You Calling My Name\". At this point, Colter had established herself as a big-selling \"albums artist,\" rather than a casual honky-tonk hitmaker, given that her talents were far more inclined to soul-rock than to mundane country music. For the remainder of the decade, Colter toured with her husband, Waylon Jennings, and released her studio album Mirriam in 1977. She then released her next album, That's the Way a Cowboy Rocks and Rolls the following year. Her success began to decline through the remainder of the decade, with her final two albums of the decade not producing any Top 40 country hits.\n\nParagraph 9: The results of the 2018 Ontario General Election saw a number of significant changes in the distribution of seats among all three major parties, in some cases unprecedented in the province's history. The Liberal Party of Ontario lost the greatest number of seats, falling to just 7/126 seats, with roughly 19% of the popular vote, and losing Official Party Status for the first time in their history. The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, in contrast, saw a large increase in seats (and a modest increase in votes) obtaining 76/124 possible seats and roughly 41% of the popular vote. The New Democratic Party of Ontario, considered the main opponents to the PC's this election, saw a significant increase in both votes and seats in the Legislature, obtaining 40/124 seats and roughly 34% of the popular vote. The result between these two parties saw the Progressive Conservatives form a majority government, while the New Democratic Party became the Official Opposition for only the third time in its history (last seen in the Ontario general election of 1987). Finally, the 2018 Ontario Election also saw the Green Party of Ontario obtain its first-ever seat in the legislature, no less won by the party leader, Mike Schreiner, in the district of Guelph, with roughly 5% of the popular vote, province-wide.\n\nParagraph 10: Following 9/11, Sasha resurfaces to tell Mundy that he's become involved in an organization to combat American military and industrial globalization. Fearing that Sasha has been radicalized, Mundy is relieved to discover that he in fact wants Mundy to help him set up a Socialist think-tank that will be financed by a Russian oligarch with left-leaning sympathies. Initially excited to participate, Mundy becomes skeptical when he learns that he and Sasha's former CIA contact is somehow involved in the scheme. Going to the schoolhouse one night, Mundy realizes too late that the boxes of books he and Sasha have been receiving in fact contain bomb-making materials and military grade weaponry; he and an arriving Sasha are both shot to death by a waiting American strike force. After their deaths, Sasha's past with the Stasi and Mundy's Islamic sympathies are used by the CIA and right-leaning American press outlets to portray them as terrorists \"with connections to Al-Qaeda\", in efforts to convince the  German government to support the United States in its War on Terror. After Mundy's death, Amory, his controller from the British intelligence service during his espionage years, tries to publicize the truth, but slander by the British government results in his story being totally discredited. Mundy's girlfriend and her son are deported, and Germany enters the War on Terror; per their wills, Mundy and Sasha are each buried beside their mothers in their respective home countries."}

However, Gwen secretly visits the Parry house and declares her love for Emlyn, regardless of his income. This inspires Emlyn to march to London with David and two other miners to demand that the government reopen the mine. However, when they arrive in London, they realize that the government is preoccupied with the looming threat of the German invasion of Poland. The government reopens the mine to distract and send the miners away. Upon their return to Wales, a fire breaks out in the mine, causing it to collapse and trapping the team inside. With limited oxygen remaining, one miner tries unsuccessfully to break through a weak rock with a pickaxe. Emlyn decides to use dynamite to create an exit, but David, fearing another Parry death, knocks him unconscious and activates the dynamite himself. The blast breaks through the rock, but David sacrifices his life in the process. The other miners wake up Emlyn, discover David's lifeless body, and pray for his soul. The mine is reopened, and the town celebrates as the coal is transported through the mine once again.", "The text discusses the distinct appearance and specific elements of characters in Commedia dell'arte performances. The identification of a character is often achieved through their mask and how it affects their presence on stage. The masks can be grouped into four or five classes, including old men like Pantalone and Il Dottore, the adventurous man Il Capitano, the servant Zanni, and the crooked Pulcinella. Servant characters typically have long noses, with more curve for Pantalone, and those with names ending in \"ino\" are often small and round. Traditional servant masks have big noses and smaller eyes to create a primitive and lower-class look. The Capitano's mask has a strong brow with smaller eyes to emphasize his frown. Some characters may also have hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. For example, Brighella has a swirled-up mustache, while Il Capitano has a large nose and spiked mustache. Dottore sometimes has hair or eyebrows but no upper lip. Pantalone is known for his red and black costume, long pointed beard, and easily recognizable mask. Dottore and Pantalone, though both old men, have distinct looks.", "The text discusses the tenure of McCormick as vice chancellor and provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1992 to 1995. During his time, there was a controversy over the proposed Black Cultural Center, with opponents viewing it as a separatist facility.

He was awarded the \"T. Eyres bat\" for the \"highest batting in the fourth grade\" at the clubs annual awards. He progressed through the grades playing for the 3rd grade side by 1928 and in 1929 he was promoted to the North Shore senior B side aged 18 and was then chosen for the Auckland Colts for a tour of the South Island. In his side was future first class cricketer Trevor Lyon, and New Zealand Test cricketer Giff Vivian. He only managed 1 run in a match with an Otago side on December 25. Smith scored 10 runs and took a catch in their match with Southland on December 29. On January 1 he scored 34 at Oamaru against a North Otago side. It was said that he “did not get into his stride for some time, but hit hard for his 34”. He also took a catch and a wicket as Auckland went on to win the match on the second day. On the 3rd against South Canterbury at Timaru, \"Smith came to the crease [with Auckland 98/6] and played brightly,...the rest went easily with the exception of Smith, who was undefeated\" on 43 at the end of Auckland's innings of 151. Auckland was bowled out for 125 in their second innings with Smith again not out on 7. In their final tour match against Ashburton on January 7–8 he scored 22 in a draw. He had been promoted up the order to bat at 5, after spending most of the tour at 7 or 8. After returning from the tour on January 25 he made his senior club debut for North Shore against United Suburbs. It was reported that \"Bush and R. Smith brightened the outlook. The latter, a promoted colt, was eventually bowled when attempting to put Horspool out of the ground\". On March 29 he scored 100 in a game against Eden while batting at number 4. The Auckland Star said \"the cricket was brighter than has been seen for some time past at Devonport, and this fact was in great measure due to the innings of R. Smith, who carried his bat for 100 dead. This was his first century in big cricket, and, although his innings was not chance less, he deserves high praise for his sparkling display. At no time was his batting dull, and his crisp well-timed strokes sent the ball to the boundary on fifteen occasions. more at home to the slow stuff stuff than to the faster variety of bowling, Smith thrived on leg deliveries, although his off shots were at times brilliant. With coaching he should develop into a batsman of more than ordinary ability\". After a handful of low scores to start the following season he was dropped to the B team and seemingly played no further cricket for North Shore.\n\nParagraph 2: McCormick served as vice chancellor and provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1992 to 1995.  His tenure was marked by the settling of a controversy over a proposed Black Cultural Center.  More than a dozen students were arrested in a sit-in protest demanding construction of the facility, which opponents viewed as an attempt to create a separatist facility.  McCormick won campuswide support by emphasizing the academic aspects of the center and helped initiate a fundraising campaign to build it. The Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History  opened in 2004.\n\nParagraph 3: At the age of 15, Kelly toured the Caribbean as part of Ray Abrams' R&B band. Kelly made his recording debut aged 16, playing on saxophonist Hal Singer's 1948 \"Cornbread\", which became a Billboard R&B chart-topping hit. In the following year, Kelly recorded with vocalist Babs Gonzales; these tracks included his first recorded solos. Other R&B bands that Kelly played with included those led by Hot Lips Page (1948 or earlier), Eddie \"Cleanhead\" Vinson (1949), and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis (1950). Material from sessions on July 25 and August 1, 1951, formed Piano Interpretations, a trio album that was Kelly's recording debut as leader, released by Blue Note Records later that year. Critic Scott Yanow indicates that, at this stage of his career, Kelly's main influence was Bud Powell, but that his playing \"displayed some of the joy of Teddy Wilson's style along with his own chord voicings\". Kelly became better known after joining vocalist Dinah Washington's band in 1951. After this, he played in bands led by Lester Young in the spring of 1952, and Dizzy Gillespie, recording with the latter later in 1952. In September of that year, just as Kelly was beginning to build a reputation, he was drafted into the army.\n\nParagraph 4: A month later, Dick's choir appears at a competition but only David performs for Dick's memory. The mine has been closed since the disaster and the rest of the miners are reduced to gathering coal from the top of a spoil heap, but they are unable to make the same amount of money that the mine had paid them and many have to claim social benefits. A year later, Mrs Parry is struggling with five children to care for and is visited by Mrs Owen—the mother of Emlyn's fiancée, Gwen—who snaps that Gwen is not allowed marry Emlyn because he cannot make enough money to look after her. Gwen later sneaks to the Parry house and tells Emlyn that she would marry him no matter his income, which gives Emlyn the idea to march to London and demand that the government reopens the mine. Emlyn takes David and two other miners and they walk to London, and arrive the day after Germany invaded Poland. The British government are busy focusing on building up the army and reopen the mine to send the gatecrashers away. The team return to Wales and attempt to reopen the mine, but a large fire causes the mine to collapse which traps the team inside. Their candle flickers, indicating the oxygen is disappearing and David estimates they have an hour left until suffocation. One miner finds a weak rock and tries to break through with a pickaxe but he and David fail. Emlyn decides to leave the group to explode an exit through with dynamite, but, knowing that it could lead to another Parry death, David sneaks away as the rest of their team pray and punches Emlyn unconscious, activating the dynamite and breaking through the rock. The other two miners wake up Emlyn, discover David's lifeless body nearby and pray for David's soul. The mine is reopened and the town sing in unison as the coal is transported through the mine.\n\nParagraph 5: Each character has specific elements and a distinct appearance that makes them recognizable in performances across the world. A character's identification is often found through their mask and how it impacts their presence on stage. There are four or five classes that the masks can be grouped into: the old men such as Pantalone and Il Dottore; the young and adventurous man, Il Capitano; the servant sometimes named Zanni; and another old man though more crooked and crippled Pulcinella. The servant characters such as Zanni typically will have a long nose, sometimes with more curve for Pantalone, and the servants whose names that end in \"ino\" such as Truffaldino or Arlecchino are more often small and round. To follow traditional masks the servant characters such as Zanni should have big noses and smaller eyes, this creates a more animal look making them seem more primitive, as the servant is lower than the master. The zanni mask was one of the first and was a full mask, covering the full face and sometimes head, until the bottom of the mouth was removed. Capitano's mask has a strong brow, in a frown, wide eyes would only make his farrowed brow less prominent so the smaller eyes are better for him as well. Some characters also have hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Brighella is one character mentioned to have a beard in some early mentions of masked characters. He is often known to have a mustache now that is swirled up to give him the mischievous feeling. Il Capitano is often described as having a long nose as well as Zanni, though typically larger. He also has a mustache sometimes that is a stiff and strong mustache under such a large nose, it almost looks like spikes poking out. Dottore also sometimes has hair, in the form of a small mustache, or eyebrows, and no upper lip. His mask covers the actors forehead and nose exposing their cheeks. Leaving the cheeks exposed so that the actor may use blush to create the look that he enjoys his spirits. Pantalone is known for his red and black costume but also his beard and easily recognizable mask.  His long pointed beard looks almost like an extension of his equally long nose, he sometimes also has a mustache and some bushy eyebrows to give him a very distinct look. Dottore and Pantalone though both old men, have very different looks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Commedia delArte An Actors Handbook|last=Rudlin|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nParagraph 6: Whilst acknowledging the mixed origins of the Chernyakiv culture, Peter Heather suggests that the culture is ultimately a reflection of the Goths' domination of the Pontic area. He cites literary sources that attest that the Goths were the centre of political attention at this time. In particular, the culture's development corresponds well with Jordanes' tale of Gothic migration from Gothiscandza to Oium, under the leadership of Filimer. Moreover, he highlights that crucial external influences that catalysed Chernyakhov cultural development derived from the Wielbark culture. Originating in the mid-1st century, it spread from south of the Baltic Sea (from territory around later Pomerania) down the Vistula in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Wielbark elements are prominent in the Chernyakhov zone, such as typical 'Germanic' pottery, brooch types and female costume, and, in particular, weaponless bi-ritual burials. Although cultures may spread without substantial population movements, Heather draws attention to a decrease in the number of settlements in the original Pomeranian Wielbark heartland as evidence of a significant population movement. Combined with Jordanes' account, Heather concludes that a movement of Goths (and other east Germanic groups such as Heruli and Gepids) \"played a major role in the creation of the Cernjachove culture\". He clarifies that this movement was not a single, royal-led, migration, but was rather accomplished by a series of small, sometimes mutually antagonistic groups.\n\nParagraph 7: Manchester United's record appearance-maker is Ryan Giggs, who made a total of 963 appearances over a 23-year playing career; he broke Bobby Charlton's previous appearance record in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final. Giggs also holds the record for the most starts, having started in 797 matches. Charlton was also the club's top goalscorer with 249 goals in his 17 years with the club. He held the mark for 45 years, until Charlton's mark was overtaken by Wayne Rooney scoring his 250th goal during the 2016–17 season; Rooney finished his 13-year tenure with Manchester United with 253 goals in 559 appearances. Other than Charlton, Giggs and Rooney, only seven players have made more than 500 appearances for the club, including three members of the 1968 European Cup-winning team (Tony Dunne, Alex Stepney and Bill Foulkes as well as Charlton) and three members of the 1999 Treble-winning team (Denis Irwin, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes as well as Giggs); the seventh is Joe Spence, who played for the club during the interwar period. Other than Charlton and Rooney, only two players (Denis Law and Jack Rowley) have scored more than 200 goals for the club. The most recent player to reach 100 appearances for the club is Bruno Fernandes, who reached the milestone on 2 December 2021.\n\nParagraph 8: Things change when Seibei's childhood friend Tomoe (sister of Iinuma Michinojo, one of his better, kinder samurai friends and much higher ranked in the clan) returns to town. Tomoe is atypical in that she was a tom-boy as a child and as an adult questions points of etiquette, such as obeying her elder brother's wife and not attending peasant festivals. Recently divorced from an abusive alcoholic husband (Koda, a samurai captain), Tomoe finds comfort and solace with Seibei's daughters. Tomoe's ex-husband Koda barges into the household of Michinojo in the middle of night in a drunken demand for Tomoe and challenges Michinojo to a duel which Seibei accepts on Michinojo's behalf believing Michinojo could not win. This takes place with Seibei knowing his clan forbids duels and the penalty is usually death for the winner as the loser is already dead. Michinojo arrives before Seibei and is facing Koda. Seibei interrupts and decides to use only a wooden stick whilst Koda brandishes a steel katana. Koda, after being disarmed and asked if that can be the end of it, picks up his sword so Seibei knocks him unconscious, sparing both their lives. A few days later, Captain of the Guard Yogo passes by Seibei while Seibei is working in the stores and quietly announces he is friends with Koda who has asked him for help in seeking vengeance on Seibei. Recognising that Seibei has some skill and learning that Seibei has learnt a particular style of fighting Yogo hopes they can duel someday. Seibei's workmates learn of the duel and wonder if they should stop calling him by his nickname.\n\nParagraph 9: Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em was released on February 12, 1990. It features the successful single \"U Can't Touch This\", which sampled Rick James' 1981 single, \"Super Freak\". It was produced, recorded and mixed by Felton Pilate and James Earley, on a modified tour bus in 1989. Despite heavy airplay and a No. 27 chart debut, \"U Can't Touch This\" peaked at No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, because it was only released as a twelve-inch single. However, the album was a No. 1 success for 21 weeks, due primarily to this single – the first time ever for a rap recording on the pop charts. The song has been used in many movies and television shows to date, and appears on soundtrack and compilation albums as well (such as Man of the House and Back 2 Back Hits).\n\nParagraph 10: Satellite channel The Vault began repeating 1991–92 and 1996–97 episodes from December 2006 on Saturday mornings, similar to the shows original timeslot on ITV, though not in chronological order. The first episode to be broadcast was the 1992 special. The Vault also aired repeats of the repeats on the following Thursday. Due to the sponsors of the show being included in the show's titles, The Vault had to re-edit the episodes and blur out the sponsors' logos, as they are no longer affiliated with the show. The Video Visuals logo was also cut from the episodes despite Video Visuals being part of CSC Media Group, which owns and operates The Vault. The repeats also aired without the channel's \"V\" graphic in the corner of the screen, but on-screen competition graphics were aired and proved unpopular with viewers - such competition graphics still air to this day across the CSC Media Group network. On several occasions, episodes were cut off abruptly to unplanned commercial breaks and blank screens, and some airings were accidentally ones that had already been shown on The Vault's run of the show. One scheduled episode failed to air completely and was replaced with another programme, which led to a double bill being shown the following weekend."}
{"queries": ["During World War II, the distribution of small paperbacks to military forces led to a demand for cheap books among the American population. This resulted in the emergence of a new trend in publishing after the war, known as \"pulp\" fiction. These books were inexpensive, sensational, and widely distributed using new technology. Despite being considered low-brow, many pulp authors are now celebrated. Pulp fiction often addressed taboo topics such as drugs, gangs, crime, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it faced less censorship, although publishers were cautious about certain themes. In terms of lesbian fiction, pulp books provided the only access to stories involving lesbian characters for many people in certain locations.", "The text explains the origin of the name \"Ori\" in the television series Stargate, which comes from the word \"origin\". The executive producer, Robert C. Cooper, created the word \"Origin\" to represent the religion of the Ori. Cooper was interested in exploring the philosophical arguments surrounding religion and the challenge of proving the existence of God. Unlike the previous antagonists in the show, the Goa'uld, who were proven to be false gods through their technology, the Ori were ascended gods, making it difficult to disprove their existence. Although Cooper wanted to entertain viewers primarily, he saw the storyline as a reflection of real-life conflicts arising from differences in beliefs. He was particularly interested in exploring the mysterious nature of religious belief and the passion it invokes.

Williams also co-wrote five of the songs whilst her brother Erron Williams, produced numerous tracks. She revealed in an interview with Gospel Flava that she \"received tremendous support\" from Music World, saying, \"they came to me. There wasn't a question as to what type of music I was going to do. Music World has a Gospel division and I'm the first artist to come out on Music World and in the Gospel division. I'd love to do more and more Gospel projects\". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, \"I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church\". Furthermore, she explained, \"I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school.\" In discussing the musical transition she said, \"it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought that it would be a perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that.

It's in my heart.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Sir William Davenant succeeded Jonson in 1638, and the title of poet laureate was conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in 1670 two years after Davenant's death, coupled with a pension of £300 and a butt of Canary Islands wine. The post then became a regular institution, though the emoluments varied, Dryden's successors being T. Shadwell, who originated annual birthday and New Year odes; Nahum Tate; Nicholas Rowe; Laurence Eusden; Colley Cibber; William Whitehead; Thomas Warton; Henry James Pye; Robert Southey; William Wordsworth; Alfred Tennyson; and, four years after Tennyson's death, Alfred Austin. The office took on a new luster from the personal distinction of Southey, Wordsworth and Tennyson; it had fallen into contempt before Southey, and on Tennyson's death there was a considerable feeling that no possible successor was acceptable, William Morris and Algernon Charles Swinburne being hardly court poets. Eventually, however, the undesirability of breaking with tradition for temporary reasons, and thus severing the one official link between literature and the state, prevailed over the protests against following Tennyson by any one of inferior genius. Abolition was similarly advocated when Thomas Warton and William Wordsworth died. The poet laureate, being a court official, was considered responsible for producing formal and appropriate verses on birthdays and state occasions; but his activity in this respect has varied, according to circumstances, and the custom ceased to be obligatory after Pye's death. Wordsworth stipulated, before accepting the honor, that no formal effusions from him should be considered a necessity; but Tennyson was generally happy in his numerous poems of this class. The emoluments of the post have varied; Ben Jonson first received a pension of 100 marks, and later an annual \"terse of Canary wine.\" To Pye an allowance of £27 was made instead of the wine. Tennyson drew £72 a year from the Lord Chamberlain's department, and £27 from the Lord Steward's in lieu of the \"butt of sack.\"\n\nParagraph 4: The name \"Ori\" comes from the word \"origin,\" as in the origin of the Ancients. When executive producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of \"origin,\" he retcon-invented the word \"Origin\" as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as \"how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?\" Unlike the Goa'uld, who were quickly proven to not be gods after killing them and figuring out their technology, it would be hard to present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference to them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the \"magic powers\" of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that \"it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something [...] what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do.\" Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should \"first and foremost [...] entertain people,\" he considered it representative of television and the media \"mak[ing] people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box–whatever they want you to believe–they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people.\" For Cooper, \"the followers of the Ori were the interesting part,\" and he \"wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that.\" Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings and the resulting \"mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes.\" The producers therefore inserted the Ori into the story's background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.\n\nParagraph 5: During World War II, the military distributed small paperbacks to its forces, causing a large population of Americans to become accustomed to having access to cheap books and thus creating a demand for the same easy access to reading material when the soldiers returned home. As a result, in the years after the war, there appeared a new and often subversive trend in publishing that allowed for books to be written, cheaply produced, and widely distributed using technology previously unavailable. These books were dubbed \"pulp\" fiction because they were inexpensive and usually sensational or low-brow, much like the \"pulp\" magazines of the first half of the 20th century. Pulps were not necessarily \"low brow.\" Many pulp authors are now celebrated with commemorative hardcover editions.  These mass market paperbacks, printed and bound on cheap paper, often addressed \"dirty\" topics like drugs, gangs, white slavery, crime, murder, and homosexuality. Because the literature was not respected, it was not censored as readily, although most of the larger paperback publishers were wary of postal censorship, and, for instance, took care not to publish works that were overly supportive of \"deviant\" lifestyles. In terms of lesbian fiction, these books were the only ones available in many locations to people who had no previous access to information or stories that involved lesbian characters.\n\nParagraph 6: The land was originally purchased in 1917. Rutgers Gardens—then called Horticultural Farm No. 1, housed the Experiment Station's peach-breeding program, although ornamental displays were also established in the early 1920s in conjunction with ongoing ornamental research. In 1930, the farm featured more than 600 varieties of dahlias and iris, including test gardens developed in coordination with the Dahlia Society of New Jersey and the American Iris Society. Trials of gladiolus were also established, in cooperation with the New Jersey Gladiolus Society. These and other displays were opportunities to showcase selected and developed varieties in cooperation with community organizations. Around this time, a shrub display garden containing over 200 species and numerous varieties was established, which remains one of the oldest surviving sections of the existing collection (which was expanded between 1930 and 1950). Some of the oldest hollies at Rutgers Gardens were planted in the late 1930s, and expanded through the 40s, 50s, and into the 60s, as part of an active breeding program. Many of these make up the foundation of what is now a significant collection. A 1936 photo of Horticultural Farm No. 1 shows a series of nine display gardens, of which the bearded iris display was the precursor to the current Donald B. Lacey Display Garden, originally constructed in 1964. Later additions and removals of plant, as well the establishment of various new ornamental and tribute gardens, have shaped Rutgers Gardens into its current form.The name of Rutgers Gardens is strongly associated with that of Bruce \"Doc\" Hamilton. In the 1990s, despite strong opposition, Rutgers University planned to sell Rutgers Gardens for urban development. In 1993, Dr. Bruce Hamilton, Rutgers professor, accepted responsibility for directing the Gardens' management and funding. Thanks to his dedication, to generous supporters, and to the work of many volunteers, the Gardens survived for everybody's enjoyment.\n\nParagraph 7: Hachiya's diary cover the period from Aug. 6, 1945 to Sept. 30, 1945. He described the effects of the atomic bomb blast from its first flash in the early morning as he rested from his night shift as an air warden at the hospital. The force of the blast stripped all the clothes from his body but he and his wife survived, however they both received serious burns to their bodies and had to journey to the hospital Michihiko worked at. When Michihiko returned to the hospital that he worked in, the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, he spent the night in the care of the hospital staff who were not seriously injured. After his injuries healed, Michihiko started making his daily rounds that he would have normally made as a doctor. The staff and patients at the hospital call the atomic bomb that hit their city \"pikadon\". Pika describes a flash of light and don describes an explosive sound. As time passes an understanding of what hit their city clears up, and historical events such as the surrender of Japan are brought up. The condition of the hospital also drastically improves as more medical supplies are brought into the city, allowing them to better treat patients. After the bombing he wrote the book The Hiroshima Diary. This book describes what happened to him and what he saw.\n\nParagraph 8: Christmas is fast approaching, and British schoolteacher Bri is bitter and vexed upon seeing his classroom of schoolboys loudly talking and interrupting him. He forces them to put their hands on their heads and sit there in silence well after the dismissal bell has sounded, whereupon he has a fantasy of a nude blonde woman, makes a Freudian slip comment about breasts, and mischievously flees the school in his aging vehicle (while still leaving the schoolboys sitting there, never dismissing them), returning home to spend the holiday with his family. He plays a playful prank on Sheila, his wife, taping a fake rubber spider to his face. Sheila is an eccentric, ditzy housewife who collects a wide assortment of domestic pets, including guinea pigs, a Siamese cat and two parakeets. The couple's quirky banter becomes increasingly frenzied and bizarre, and when they enter the back room of their home, it's revealed that they have an adolescent daughter, Josephine (affectionately called \"Joe Egg\" and \"Jo\"). Josephine had some unexplained form of severe intellectual disability, unable to walk, use the toilet or speak to anybody. A flashback to a trip at the beach reveals that Sheila had a narrow pelvic opening, resulting in a risky and troublesome birth. Bri and Sheila pretend to be Josephine back and forth in order to fantasize a facsimile of a conversation with her. Josephine urinates, and as Bri has to change her, he begs her to say something to him, while Sheila talks to herself casually. The couple is increasingly distracted by their myriad sexual games at home, coupled with nosy neighbours and Josephine's doctors and nurses. Bri worries that Josephine is \"fat\" and \"jaundiced\", and wonders about the long-term state of her health. He and Sheila increasingly rely on dark humour to make their pain bearable. As they consider Josephine's quality of life, at one point they even contemplate euthanasia, while neighbours and friends point out the potential merits of committing the girl to a nursing home. As Josephine becomes terminally ill and close to death, Sheila suspects that Bri may have something to do with it. They struggle to hold their family together, along with a close-knit group of wacky friends and relatives, while Josephine languishes at home. When Josephine eventually survives, Sheila finally realizes the mental toll the whole ordeal has had on Bri, and she admits quietly to him her plans to leave the girl in a residential hospital forever, hoping to have a second honeymoon with her husband. Bri flees the house with a suitcase that morning, boarding a train for London, which he falls asleep on. Sheila wanders their home talking to each of her pets, then kissing Josephine, before she strips naked and climbs back into bed alone.\n\nParagraph 9: The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men. Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote. A subject that drew Irving and Evans deep into debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the \"Jewish Question\" on the \"back-burner\" until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, \"It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?\" \n\nParagraph 10: Seattle Sounders FC won the U.S. Open Cup in the team's inaugural season of 2009. The Sounders won the U.S. Open Cup again in 2010, becoming the first MLS team to achieve back-to-back U.S. Open Cup Titles. Seattle continued its U.S. Open Cup dominance in the 2011 campaign, becoming the fourth team ever to win the tournament in three consecutive years (the last being the Greek American AA in 1967–69). The Sounders beat the Chicago Fire 2–0 in front of a then record-setting MLS crowd of 35,615 at CenturyLink Field (now Lumen Field) on October 4, 2011. On September 16, 2014, the Sounders captured their fourth U.S. Open Cup title, overcoming the Philadelphia Union – on the Union's home pitch – in extra time by a final score of 3–1.  On October 25, 2014, in front of a crowd of 57,673 at CenturyLink Field, the Sounders topped the LA Galaxy by a score of 2–0 to claim their first MLS Supporters' Shield. The Sounders captured their first Western Conference title when they defeated the Colorado Rapids by an aggregate score of 3–1 on November 27, 2016, in Commerce City, Colorado. Then, on December 10, 2016 in front of a crowd of 36,000 at BMO Field, the Sounders won their first MLS Cup against Toronto FC in a penalty shootout by a score of 5–4. The following season - on December 9, 2017 - the Sounders returned to the MLS Cup against Toronto FC (held again at BMO Field). This time, the Sounders lost the Cup to the home team by a score of 0–2. On November 10, 2019, the Sounders played in their third MLS Cup against Toronto FC, winning 3–1 to achieve their second title with a club-record home attendance of 69,274. On May 4, 2022 - in front of a home crowd of 68,751 - the Sounders became the first MLS team to win the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League, defeating Mexican side Pumas UNAM with an aggregate score of 5 goals to 2.

The teeth are heterodont, meaning that they have different shapes along the jaw. The first four dentary teeth of the lower jaw project forward, with the first tooth angled only 10° above the horizontal. These teeth are long and spoon-shaped with hooked edges. They have carinae, or sharp edges, that are weakly serrated. Serrations are more evident along the rear edge the posterior teeth in the back of the jaw, which are also recurved and laterally compressed (flattened from the side), resembling the less unusual teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. The margin of the dentary curves downward so that the alveoli (tooth sockets) of the front teeth are directed forward. In fact, the alveolus of the first tooth is actually situated lower than the bottom edge of the rest of the lower jaw. The lower part of the rear edge of the dentary has a long prong, known as a ventral process. This differs from the situation in abelisaurids, which have a much shorter ventral process. On the other hand, the upper part of the rear edge of the dentary is very similar to that of abelisaurids such as Majungasaurus and Carnotaurus. This part of the bone possesses an array of four small structures, three of which line a socket which connects to the surangular bone at the back of the lower jaw. Although the surangular bone is not preserved, several other bones of the lower jaw are, including a triangular angular bone, a gently curving prearticular bone, and a damaged yet notably concave articular bone. The angular and prearticular formed the lower edge of a large and rounded in the lower jaw (known as a mandibular fenestra) while the articular bone formed the lower part of the jaw joint. A long and tapering hyoid (tongue bone) has also been preserved.\n\nParagraph 2:  Edward Woodward as Robert McCall: A veteran operative of The Company who becomes disillusioned with sacrificing ordinary people for the perceived greater good. He quits and takes out a newspaper advert offering his services to those who need it as The Equalizer. McCall himself is divorced, a \"lost dad\" long estranged from his son, Scott (William Zabka). Scott comes back into his life as a young adult who is at first bitterly critical of his father's world, but then becomes drawn into that world to the dismay of both of his parents. McCall also lost a woman he was in love with, a fellow operative named Manon Brevard, and discovers that she had secretly given birth to his daughter Yvette. McCall appears to be independently wealthy, as although he almost never takes payment for his work, he owns a high-end apartment, is always well dressed and drives a Jaguar XJ6 car (registered 5809-AUG). He enjoys classical music (playing the piano himself), fine wine and dining and is occasionally seen dating and trying to live a \"normal\" life, only for work or his past to get in the way. His father, William, was a British Army officer who was killed in Egypt in 1952 when McCall was 19 and also an army officer. His mother was a working class American entertainer and his father was disinherited by his family and shunned by his regiment for being seen to be marrying beneath himself. McCall had a strained relationship with his father, whom he blamed for remaining overseas and leaving him at boarding school while his mother was dying. He was also guilt-ridden at his various actions during the Cold War, notably helping to establish the dictatorship in Chile and working with South Africa's apartheid regime in Angola. Woodward was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series four years in a row but never won, and was also nominated in 1986 and 1987 for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama, winning in 1986.\n\nParagraph 3: In September 2015 it was announced that the Medibank Icehouse had been renamed the O'Brien Group Arena following a lease takeover by the O'Brien Catering Group.

The games, promoted under the title of the Brisbane Battle, will be held at Iceworld Boondall and Iceworld Acacia Ridge on 14 and 15 May respectively. The AIHL have not held a game in Queensland since the suspension of the Gold Coast Blue Tongues in 2012. In February 2016 the Sydney Ice Dogs announced that Reach Crane Trucks had renewed their sponsorship for 2016, extending the original three-year deal that was signed in 2013. The Ice Dogs later signed TAFE SWSi Aboriginal Learning Circle as a new sponsor for the season. Also in February Hards Transport renewed their naming rights sponsorship of the Adelaide Adrenaline. The Adrenaline also signed new sponsors Reading Cinemas, Paxton Wines and Mortgage Choice Malvern and extended their deal with the Hilton Hotel's MyBar as their official post-game venue. In March 2016 the CBR Brave signed Casino Canberra and McDonald's ACT as major sponsors and Canberra Toyota as their vehicle sponsor. The CBR Brave also extended their deal with Anytime Fitness as the club's official gym partner and the Hellenic Club of Canberra as their post-game partner and renewed their sponsorship deal with Jordo's Chop Shop. On 21 March 2016 the Bears announced that they had formed a partnership with the Australian Defence Force Ice Hockey Association's Army Knights for 2016. This was followed by the CBR Brave forming a partnership with the Navy Tigersharks. Both partnerships aim to help promote ice hockey within the Defence Force and develop emerging talent. The Bears partnership deal also includes discounted tickets for Defence Force members during the season. The Sydney Bears have reached a deal with Hawkesbury Radio to broadcast at least two of their home games for the 2016 season while also continuing to broadcast via their normal Mixlr stream. The Perth Thunder will also start live broadcasting their home games via Mixlr for the 2016 season.

Tony lies to Diane and tells her he's going to a food conference and goes to a hotel with Sinead. Diane is worried when the flat alarm goes off and Tony is away and not available to fix it, and the alarm persists in annoying the whole village. Trevor suggests Diane look at Tony's credit card details to find out where he is staying and she tracks him down to a hotel. However, Tony is there and promises to come home, leaving Sinead behind. Diane shows up to question the hotel on who Tony was staying with, however the receptionist refuses to give any information other than Tony was with another woman. Tony is forced to admit that he is having an affair and Sinead says she went to the hotel to confront him about it. Diane is devastated, but forgives Tony and puts their wedding back on. On her hen night, Diane discovers Sinead is pregnant and confronts her about the father. Sinead informs her that it was her fling, Daryl (Rhys Howells) who fathered her child, so Diane invites him to her wedding to Tony. However, when Diane learns from Daryl that he and Sinead never slept together, she realises that Tony and Sinead are having an affair when she spots them looking at each other in the church. Diane publicly embarrasses them both and changes the locks on the flat and The Hutch, seeking support from Lockie Campbell (Nick Rhys). Diane refuses to forgive Sinead when Sinead tells her the affair was in revenge for Diane not believing her about baby Katy's death, but later rushes to apologise to Sinead afterwards. She finds Sinead and Tony in an embrace and so storms off and has sex with Lockie. Diane soon regrets what she has done and apologises to Lockie. After her affair, Lockie's wife Porsche McQueen (Twinnie Lee Moore) discovers that she had slept with Lockie whilst decorating Diane's room. The pair fight and Diane slips on wallpaper and falls out of the window. Diane regains consciousness in the hospital and Dr. Charles S'avage (Andrew Greenough) informs her that she has broken her ribs. Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) injects her with morphine to take away the pain and she tells her that she had seen Tegan on a video informing Dee Dee that she is her real mother. During the night, the Gloved Hand Killer (who is Lindsey Butterfield) gains entry to Diane's ward and injects her with potassium chloride, the same chemical the assailant used to kill Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener) and Will Savage (James Atherton). Diane's heart monitor drops to 0 and the unknown assailant leaves the ward and leaves Diane for dead. Diane is rushed into resuscitation and soon makes a full recovery, after suffering a heart attack from the potassium chloride.\n\nParagraph 5: The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns.  There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35).  Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure.  Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts.  As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark.  However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11).  It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time.  This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper.  Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts.  Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible.  The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44).  Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35).  This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts.  The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history.  There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: it is very susceptible to water damage.  Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace.  It is believed that \"Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,\" however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).\n\nParagraph 6: Francisco Herrera was born in Seville in 1576. Francisco Pacheco was his teacher, but Herrera soon broke away from the timid style and Italian traditions of Spanish painting of his day, and became the pioneer of that bold, vigorous, effective, and natural style whose preeminent exponent was Velázquez. Herrera was the first to use long brushes, which may, in part, account for his \"modern\" technique and dexterous brushwork. Many authorities ascribe to him the foundation of the Spanish School. His great talent brought him many pupils, whom his passionate temper and rough manners soon drove away. Velázquez, when thirteen years old, was placed under this great professor, and remained a year with him. Herrera, who was an accomplished worker in bronze, engraved medals skilfully. This gave rise to the charge of counterfeiting, and he fled for sanctuary to the Jesuit College, for which he painted \"The Triumph of St. Hermengild\", a picture so impressive that when Philip IV saw it (1621) he immediately pardoned the painter. Herrera thereupon returned to Seville. His ungoverned temper soon drove his son to Rome and his daughter to a nunnery. Herrera's pictures are full of energy, the drawing is good and the colouring so cleverly managed that the figures stand out in splendid relief. Many of his small easel pictures, in oil, represent fairs, dances, interiors of inns, and deal with the intimate life of Spain. His large works are nearly all religious. In Seville he painted a \"St. Peter\" for the cathedral and a \"Last Judgment\" for the Church of San Bernardo, the latter being considered his masterpiece. After executing many commissions in his native town he removed to Madrid (1650), where he won great renown. In the archiepiscopal palace are four large canvases, one of which, \"Moses Smiting the Rock\", is celebrated for its dramatic qualities and daring technique. In the cloister of the Merced Calzada is a noteworthy series of paintings whose subjects are drawn from the life of St. Ramon. He painted much in fresco, in which medium his best effort is believed to have been on the vault of San Bonaventura, but this, with all his other frescoes, has disappeared. None of his architectural productions are mentioned, and there remain but a few of his etchings, all of which were reproductions of his paintings. One of his pictures, \"St. Basil dictating his doctrine\", is in the Louvre, and another, \"St. Matthew\", is in the Dresden Gallery. Herrera left two sons, \"el Rubio\" (the ruddy) who died before he fulfilled the great promise of his youth, and \"el Mozo\" (the younger). He was also the godfather of the Spanish-born Portuguese painter Josefa de Óbidos.\n\nParagraph 7: On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in an email that he did not expect completion of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: \"I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.\" The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. \"I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional.\" On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: \"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set.\" On December 10, 2003: \"The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway.\" A week later: \"Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with.\" On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading \"Harvard Connection,\" however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was \"completely swamped with work [that] week\" but had \"made some of the changes ... and they seem[ed] to be working great\" on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [thefacebook.com] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.\n\nParagraph 8: During Father Rale's War, at about 3:00 pm on August 23, 1724 (N. S.), a force of English colonial militia attacked Norridgewock for the last time. A force of 208 militia had left Fort Richmond (now Richmond) and divided, leaving about 80 militiamen including three Mohawks under the command of Captain Jeremiah Moulton. His militia quietly approached the village, which at that time no longer had a stockade. A startled Indian emerging from a cabin gave a war whoop, then darted back inside to get his musket. Norridgewock women and children ran from houses to swim or ford across the river and up into the woods. In the confusion, about 60 braves fired guns wildly but did little harm. At that point the militia, ordered to withhold fire until after the enemy's first volley, took aim—with deadly effect. The warriors fired again, then fled across the river, leaving 26 dead and 14 wounded. Bomazeen (or Bomaseen), the sachem, who with Sebastien de Villieu had led 250 Abenakis to Durham, New Hampshire on July 18, 1694, for the Oyster River Massacre, was shot fording the Kennebec at a place thereafter called Bomazeen Rips. From a cabin, old Chief Mogg shot one of the Mohawks, whose brother then shot him. Meanwhile, from another cabin Father Rale was firing at the militia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot through the head while reloading his gun.\n\nParagraph 9: Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote a positive review of the film, describing it as having \"a whole range of jokes that are funny primarily because they are in absolutely terrible taste.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and called it \"only a slightly above-average comedy. It starts out with a number of funny sequences, and Feldman is funny-looking for a few minutes. But I don't find him interesting enough or funny enough or likable enough to carry an entire movie.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety wrote that the film \"emerges as an often hilarious, if uneven, spoof of Foreign Legion films ... An excellent cast, top to bottom, gets the most out of the stronger scenes, and carries the weaker ones.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"There are too few jokes and rapturous inventions to sustain even the movie's brief 85 minutes, some of those that exist are strained too hard and some should have been dropped after the first draft. It gets to be a long siege at the fort.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \"Although there's no difference in the games they like to play, Feldman seems a shaky, bush-league terrible joker compared to a prodigal, big-league terrible joker like [Mel] Brooks ... Feldman often seems uncertain about whether a sight gag will pay off, so to reassure himself, he'll run it into the ground.\" Penelope Gilliatt of The New Yorker called the film \"recklessly funny\" and \"a hilarious exercise in taste run amok.\" Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin declared it \"a ragbag of a film which looks like nothing so much as a Monty Python extravaganza in which inspiration has run dry and the comic timing gone sadly awry.\"\n\nParagraph 10: The first part of Faust is not divided into acts, but is structured as a sequence of scenes in a variety of settings. After a dedicatory poem and a prelude in the theater, the actual plot begins with a prologue in Heaven, where the Lord bets Mephistopheles, an agent of the Devil, that Mephistopheles cannot lead astray the Lord's favorite striving scholar, Dr. Faust. We then see Faust in his study, who, disappointed by the knowledge and results obtainable by science's natural means, attempts and fails to gain knowledge of nature and the universe by magical means. Dejected in this failure, Faust contemplates suicide, but is held back by the sounds of the beginning Easter celebrations. He joins his assistant Wagner for an Easter walk in the countryside, among the celebrating people, and is followed home by a poodle. Back in the study, the poodle transforms itself into Mephistopheles, who offers Faust a contract: he will do Faust's bidding on earth, and Faust will do the same for him in Hell (if, as Faust adds in an important side clause, Mephistopheles can get him to be satisfied and to want a moment to last forever). Faust signs in blood, and Mephistopheles first takes him to Auerbach's tavern in Leipzig, where the devil plays tricks on some drunken revelers. Having then been transformed into a young man by a witch, Faust encounters Margaret (Gretchen) and she excites his desires. Through a scheme involving jewellery and Gretchen's neighbour Marthe, Mephistopheles brings about Faust's and Gretchen's liaison. After a period of separation, Faust seduces Gretchen, who accidentally kills her mother with a sleeping potion given to her by Faust. Gretchen discovers that she is pregnant, and her torment is further increased when Faust and Mephistopheles kill her enraged brother in a sword fight. Mephistopheles seeks to distract Faust by taking him to a witches' sabbath on Walpurgis Night, but Faust insists on rescuing Gretchen from the execution to which she was sentenced after drowning her newborn child while in a state of madness. In the dungeon, Faust vainly tries to persuade Gretchen to follow him to freedom. At the end of the drama, as Faust and Mephistopheles flee the dungeon, a voice from heaven announces Gretchen's salvation."}
{"queries": ["This text provides a summary of the writing career and influence of Singaporean poet Edwin Thumboo. It notes that in the 1950s, Thumboo wrote lyrical poetry inspired by personal experiences and influenced by the English literary tradition. However, he shifted his focus to the public sphere in the 1970s, advocating for the creation of a national literature in post-independence Singapore. His collection of poetry, \"Gods Can Die,\" explored themes related to Singapore's national life. His subsequent anthologies, \"Ulysses by the Merlion\" and \"A Third Map,\" further established his reputation as a national poet committed to expressing a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore. Thumboo is often referred to as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate due to his nationalistic-themed poems and his promotion of Singapore literature. His poem, \"Ulysses by the Merlion,\" was inspired by Irish mythology and history, particularly the works of W.B. Yeats. Thumboo considers himself a myth-inspired poet and views myths as narratives that provide stability in a multicultural society. The poem has also inspired other Singaporean poets to write their own Merlion-themed verses. A copy of \"Ulysses\" is installed on a plaque near the Merlion statue in Singapore.", "The text explains that the abyssal zone, a deep area of the ocean, is undergoing negative effects from climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and potential deep sea mining. While the zone is not immediately impacted by rising temperatures, it is affected by ocean acidification and pollution, particularly plastics. These substances are decreasing the already limited biomass in the abyssal zone. Overfishing also poses a threat as it reduces the amount of dead material that sinks to the seafloor, which is essential for the ecosystem. Additionally, the text mentions that deep sea mining operations could be disastrous for the abyssal zone, as they can lead to increased pollution, destruction of habitats, and harm to the overall ocean ecosystem.", "The text explains the use of palatalization marks (acute accent or apostrophe) in typography and handwriting. The marks are placed above the letter if it has no ascender, but to the right if it does. In computing, it is common to place the apostrophe after the letter due to font limitations. The article follows this convention."], "answers": ["Paragraph 9", "Paragraph 3", "Paragraph 4"], "context": "Paragraph 1: The hoax circulated around Greek websites  and was widely reproduced without verification by many reputable sources from newspapers to the then Minister for National Education and Religious Affairs (see Urban legend spread below). According to the \"Hellenic Quest\" story, CNN reported that Apple Computer is developing a software product for teaching Ancient Greek language to foreigners and scientists, in the light of the upcoming development of supercomputers that will use Ancient Greek as their programming interface, due to this language's superior logical structure. (This prediction often attributed by the hoax writer to Bill Gates.) A prototype computer that is allegedly under development as part of this project is called \"Ibycus\".\n\nParagraph 2: Aside from the mini-studio, the attic contained two other rooms: a small guest bedroom and a games room used for recreation. Lennon filled it with three full sets of the model car racing game, Scalextric. When not in the attic, Lennon could usually be found in the sunroom watching television or reading newspapers. He would also walk in the garden with his black cat on his shoulder (he had ten cats in total). His drug intake, particularly LSD and hashish, but also amphetamine, was high for much of the time he lived at Kenwood. Drugs were taken there in the company of people such as Marianne Faithfull's ex-husband John Dunbar and art dealer Robert Fraser. At one stage, under the influence of transcendental meditation, Lennon renounced both meat-eating and drugs, and buried a huge quantity of LSD in the garden, which had been obtained by representatives of The Beatles at the Monterey Pop Festival from Augustus Stanley Owsley III. He later tried to find the LSD, but could not remember where he had buried it. Although none of the lavish parties they had planned took place – which remained a source of disappointment to Cynthia – various guests (including Monkee Michael Nesmith and his wife Phyllis, Bob Dylan and Peter Cook) stayed or dined at the house, together with old friends like Ivan Vaughan and Shotton from Liverpool, or strangers Lennon had met at a party or nightclub, such as the Ad Lib. Cynthia and Lennon were beginning to lead separate lives by 1967, and it was not uncommon for Cynthia to wake up in the morning to find the house filled with people in various states of intoxication whom Lennon had met in clubs the night before. Large parts of the house were unused by the Lennons, and visitors remarked that there was frequently a strange atmosphere.\n\nParagraph 3: As with all of the rest of the natural world climate change has negative effects. Due to the zone’s depth, increasing global temperatures do not affect it as quickly or drastically as the rest of the world, but the zone is still afflicted by ocean acidification. Along with climate change and ocean acidification, pollutants, such as plastics, are also present in this zone. Plastics are especially bad for the abyssal zone due to the fact that these organisms have evolved to eat or try to eat anything that moves or appears to be detritus, resulting in most organisms consuming plastics instead of nutrients. Both ocean acidification and pollution are decreasing the already small biomass that resides within the abyssal zone. Another problem caused by humans is overfishing. Even though no fishery can fish for organisms anywhere near the abyssal zone, they are still causing harm. The abyssal zone depends on dead organisms from the upper zones sinking to the seafloor, since their ecosystem lacks producers due to lack of sunlight. As fish and other animals are removed from the ocean, the frequency and amount of dead material reaching the abyssal zone decreases. A future problem for the abyssal zone could be deep sea mining operations. The talks and planning for this industry are already underway. This could be disastrous for this extremely fragile ecosystem since the ecological dangers from mining for deep sea minerals are many. Mining could increase the amount of pollution in not only the abyssal zone, but in the ocean as a whole, and would physically destroy habitats and the seafloor. This industry represents a looming threat to the abyssal zone and the rest of the ocean's inhabitants.\n\nParagraph 4: Palatalization of consonants is marked with an acute accent (´) or apostrophe ('). In proper typography and in handwriting, the palatalisation mark does not extend above the cap height (except uppercase letters Ń, Ŕ, Ś, V́ etc.), and it is written above the letter if the letter has no ascender (ǵ, ḿ, ń, ṕ, ŕ, ś, v́ etc.) but written to the right of it otherwise (b’, d’, f’, h’, k’, l’, t’). In computing, it is not usually possible to enter these character combinations or to make them look esthetically pleasing with most common fonts, so the apostrophe is generally placed after the letter in all cases. This convention is followed in this article as well.\n\nParagraph 5: The male advertises several potential nest sites to his mate by singing at the entrance, slipping inside and so on, with the female finally selecting one. The typical nest site of a tawny owl is a tree hollow, wherein the owls will nest directly on the interior hole's surface. Tree hollows used may be as much as  above the ground, but are usually within about  of the ground. Virtually any species of deciduous tree may be used provided holes are available. These tree cavities may be of any origin, with trees that grow large such as oak, beech, poplar, maple, lime, hornbeam and alder often regularly utilized. Female may scratch out a shallow base in soil if present and sometimes seen to reportedly tear eggs into pieces as a cushion from their broods. Other tree nest locations have included those on top of a Witch's broom and on top of the tree canopy. Natural holes in trees are often the most frequently used nesting site, followed closely in recent decades many artificial nest boxes, preferably those with a  entrance or larger. Of the nest boxes erected in different parts from Kielder forest and the Glenbranter forest of Argyll, 592 nest boxes were placed at  high along the side of trees and 17.4% of which were used by tawnys (in latter 2 years of study up to 24.1%). In southeastern Scotland, all nest boxes erected in habitat were eventually utilized by tawny owls. Many nest boxes were recorded to be used as roost sites in the Milan, with only 12.3% of the 44% of nest boxes actually used by owls for breeding, usually with the owls utilizing boxes that were at least  above the ground. Nest boxes are most successful wherever natural tree cavities are scarce or absent, such as conifer forests, young successional woods and farmlands. Tawny owls may not infrequently nest in an unmodified black woodpecker hole. This species may too nest in nest of larger birds such as crows, common ravens (Corvus corax) and Eurasian magpies as well as common buzzards, black kites, northern goshawks and various eagles while the sometimes recorded as used smaller nests such as those of Eurasian jays, Eurasian sparrowhawks and common wood pigeons but these are at potential risk of collapse.  Occasionally, tawny owls have also been recorded nesting in abandoned burrows of larger mammals (e.g. red fox and European badger (Meles meles) as well as those of rabbits). Other nesting locations recorded for the species have included bare cliff ledges, between the roots of heavy tree trunks, on the bare forest floor and among heather. Also rarer still nests have been reported in the recesses of stone walls, in chimneys of large buildings, on cabins and sheds, in dovecotes and church towers. In southern Finland, 95% of 123 nest boxes put out were occupied by tawny owls in 1970–1975, natural tree hole use decreased in same period from 48% to 3%, on top of stumps from 4% to 1% and in buildings from 15% to 1%.\n\nParagraph 6: In the film, a doctor (Aryan) and a nurse (Annie), who is employed to look after a rich old man on wheel-chair, plan to usurp his property and wealth. The old Dadaji incidentally wishes to get his granddaughter (Nikita) married to Dr Aryan as he likes him. Dadaji is on medical treatment by Dr Aryan due to his heart ailment. He manages to convince Nikita to marry Dr Aryan. But even after marriage, Aryan continues his sexual acts with Annie. Nikita has a hole in her heart and cannot sustain shock and pressure. Aryan knows about this and takes advantage of her handicap. Nikita catches Aryan in his misdemeanour with Annie but he blatantly continues with his shameless acts threatening her that if Dadaji learnt about the affair, he will die of shock. Dadaji gets his will prepared naming Nikita as the heiress and Aryan is shocked since he is interested in coveting the property and wealth; so he hatches a plan with Annie so that Nikita will die of shock naturally and Dadaji will also die due to shock of Nikita's death. Aryan asks Annie to confide with Nikita and come close to her so that they can eliminate Aryan. In the process Aryan smothers Annie and convinces Nikita that Annie is dead. They take the body in a suitcase and dump it in the sea. When Dadaji asks them about missing Annie, Aryan tells him that she has left the job and gone to her home-town. Later Nikita feels that Annie's ghost comes to haunt her. Aryan convinces her that she is imagining things. She repeatedly tells Aryan to come clean and reveal the truth to the police but he manages to silence her. One day, Nikita sees a dead woman's body and screams out when she sees the face. It is not Annie. Inspector (Kadar Khan), who is investigating the death suspects Nikita's behaviour. On his probing, Nikita informs him that the nurse Annie is missing since nearly a week but she did not file missing report since she thought that the nurse had gone to her hometown and Nikita did not know her contact no. One day, the Inspector comes to meet Aryan and Nikita and shows them the suitcase which was found from the sea. He found out that it belonged to them with the help of a card inside. On his asking to open the suitcase, Nikita does so and they find it empty. Nikita is terrified and now she is convinced that Annie is alive. When Aryan is away, she gets a call from Annie that she is on her way to Nikita's mansion. Annie's arrival shocks Nikita and when Aryan also arrives, the suspense builds up. With the non-challant attitude of Aryan while talking to them, Annie realizes that he is  crook and a selfish man who is not interested in her and is using har like a pawn to achieve his goal. She joins Nikita to overpower Aryan but in the process, he grabs their throats to strangulate them to death together. He is shot from behind by Dadaji and the girls are saved. Dadaji shoots him repeatedly till he dies. The film ends with both girls dancing and enjoying together and Dadaji too joining them in the fun on his wheel-chair.\n\nParagraph 7: Narasimha and Chari are two identical twins who get separated at birth, they replace one child (chari) with another dead child unknown to the mother of the twins by a nurse and old women who happens to be the grandmother of the dead child, the cause for her doing this is that their family can't bear to lose a child third time in a row and the mother of the twins is a lone women doesn't have anyone at her side, financially weak and doesn't have strength to raise the twins at her own, so they do it in thought that it will benefit both of their families.

Bhattu asks for Chari's help to his love and he agrees, In order to impress her he takes her to pub along with Chari at the same time Narasimha also comes to the pub with his girlfriend Nandu. While Chandu dancing with Bhattu a gang misbehaves with her unable to face them to save chandu they leave the pub without telling chari unknown about the incident but the gang follows them and ask him to leave her to them, Narasimha who saw what happened inside the pub gets angrier and beats them all up while Bhattu and Chandu watch in shock, Chandu who thinks that all who did this, who saved her is Chari and falls for him.

Narasimha escapes from there, because of which two men go to Chari's house on his engagement day and make a deal that if Chari acts as Narasimha, they would give him 30 lakhs. What happens next forms the rest of the story.\n\nParagraph 8: Alder Gulch (alternatively called Alder Creek) is a place in the Ruby River valley, in the U.S. state of Montana, where gold was discovered on May 26, 1863, by William Fairweather and a group of men including Barney Hughes, Thomas Cover, Henry Rodgers, Henry Edgar and Bill Sweeney who were returning to the gold fields of Grasshopper Creek, Bannack, Montana. They were on their way to Yellowstone Country from Bannack but were waylaid by a band of Crow Indians. After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William \"Bill\" Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. However, word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town. The party stopped at the Point of Rocks, part way between Bannack and Alder Gulch, and established the Fairweather Mining District in a miners meeting. It was agreed that the discoverers were entitled to two claims and first choice. The first stampede of miners reached Alder Gulch June 6, 1863, and the population swelled to over 10,000 in less than 3 months.  The \"Fourteen Mile City\" ran the length of the gulch, and included the towns of Junction City, Adobe Town, Nevada City, Central City, Virginia City, Montana, Bear Town, Highland, Pine Grove French Town, Hungry Hollow, and Summit. Upon arrival the miners lived in brush wickiups, dugouts and under overhanging rocks until cabins could be built. The first structure built in Virginia City was the Mechanical Bakery. Virginia City, and Nevada City were the centers of commerce during the height of the Alder Gulch gold rush. In the first year the area had over 10,000 people living there. Montana Territory was established in May 1864, and the first territorial capital was Bannack. The capital then moved to Virginia City, where it remained until 1875.   The Alder Gulch diggings were the richest gold placer deposits ever discovered, and in three years $30,000,000 was taken from them, with $10,000,000 taken out in the first year.  Nowadays, except during summertime, the streets of Virginia City are usually quiet and relatively few visitors find their way to the 16 ton granite monument that marks the spot of that incredible discovery of May 26, 1863.\n\nParagraph 9: In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry based on personal experiences. Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) \"established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore\". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August – II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa. Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a \"Merlion poem\". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue.\n\nParagraph 10: CharactersDashti The narrator and the writer of the \"Book of a Thousand Days\", fifteen-year-old Dashti leaves the plains where she was raised to find work in a nearby city after her mother passes away.  As a person from the plains, she is looked down on as a \"mucker\", a low-class citizen, by nobility.  However, she accepts the role of becoming the lady's maid of Lady Saren, abiding by her oath of service to follow Saren even as she is imprisoned for seven years in a tower.  Describing herself as thin, with skinny ankles, worn-out hands, long black hair, and with birth marks, or what she calls \"blotches\" on her face and hands, Dashti is revealed to be a resilient and resourceful young woman.  The strength of her will and spirit allows her and Saren to survive in the tower and go on living after their escape, and Dashti's knowledge of songs of healing soothe the damaged spirits of those close to her.  She is deathly loyal to Lady Saren, seeing it as her duty to her ancestors and the gods she worships.Lady SarenSixteen-year-old Saren is the third child of the ruler of Titor's Garden, who regarded her as a worthless and ugly brat.  Her unusually vehement refusal to marry Lord Khasar, claiming that she is betrothed to Khan Tegus, results in her imprisonment in a tower with only one maid for company for the next seven years.  Dashti astutely perceives that Saren's lack of self-esteem and nervous disposition are the results of a deep-rooted sickness within Saren's heart and gradually helps her heal.  Though she is initially afraid of everything and easily jealous, she comes to trust Dashti as a true friend.Khan Tegus The ruler of the Song of Evela, one of the Eight Realms.  A suitor of Lady Saren, he bravely visits her in the tower where she is imprisoned, though because of Saren's fright, Dashti impersonates her to convey what she believes as Saren's feelings for the Khan.  When his visits abruptly cease and Dashti and Saren escape the tower, the two young women manage to find their way to the Song of Evela, with Dashti hoping to reunite Saren and Tegus.  However, Tegus and Dashti eventually fall in love.Lord Khasar The brutal ruler of the Thoughts of Under, who demanded Saren as a bride.  A powerful warlord seeking to conquer the Eight Realms, he possesses a terrifying secret that Saren learned and has fearfully kept hidden.Lady Vachir The ruler of Beloved of Ris who becomes engaged to Khan Tegus when he believed that Saren had perished with the destruction of Titor's Garden.  A haughty and vicious woman.My Lord Dashti and Saren's cat, given to them by Khan Tegus in the tower. Initially he prefers Dashti, but Dashti later gifts him to Saren, which helps Saren to heal from her trauma.Mucker Dashti's yak, whom she finds after she escapes the tower that's in Titor's Garden. Dashti gifts him to Khan Tegus, which later plays an important role in her exoneration. Batu Khan Tegus's chief of war. He is healed by Dashti's songs from a mortal wound, and he later aids her in defeating Khasar.Chinua Lord Khasar's chief of war, and the only one besides Saren who know his secret. He tries to protect Khasar after he turns into a wolf, but ultimately fails.Shria A worker in Khan Tegus's home of some rank. She offers Dashti and Saren jobs in the Khan's kitchen after Dashti's appearance in the city.Qacha A fellow scrubber girl in Khan Tegus's home. She is a mucker like Dashti.Gal A fellow scrubber girl in Khan Tegus's home. Her reunion with her family against all odds gives Dashti hope while imprisoned."}
{"queries": ["During the battle, two PVA battalions successfully attacked a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines at Boulder City. The PVA then targeted the Berlin and East Berlin gates, cutting off the Marines' supply and reinforcement routes. Cloud cover hindered aerial support for the Marines defending the gates, allowing the PVA to gain control of the Berlin gate and launch a second assault on the Boulder City perimeter. The remaining Marines engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat, with dwindling ammunition and increasing casualties. Company I, 3/1 Marines, attempted to reinforce the survivors but suffered heavy casualties due to intercepted radio messages. However, some of the reinforcements managed to reach Boulder City and participate in a successful counterattack. Additional reinforcements arrived later to consolidate the position. Despite this, a few PVA troops remained on the slopes nearest the Marine Line of Resistance (MLR). The PVA launched another attack on Boulder City, but Marine mortars, artillery, tanks, and aircraft were instrumental in repelling the assault. The tanks proved effective against the PVA troops, but they also attracted enemy artillery and mortar fire. F9F jets provided air support, conducting multiple missions against PVA positions threatening Boulder City and neighboring strongpoints.", "The text discusses the career of a performer named Reed, who began his career in the late 1940s.

Earnest recording of the album began in 2006, according to a Spears representative. Spears first met J.R. Rotem in Las Vegas in March, and enlisted him to work on the album after listening to Rihanna's \"SOS\". They wrote and recorded four songs together, including \"Everybody\", which was originally offered to Rihanna and the Cheetah Girls. In July, she started working with Danja, who contacted songwriters such as Keri Hilson, Jim Beanz and Corté Ellis to work with him. The team wrote seven tracks for Spears–\"Gimme More\", \"Break the Ice\", \"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\", \"Hot as Ice\", \"Perfect Lover\", \"Outta This World\" and \"Get Back\". Danja explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was \"left to do pretty much whatever I wanted to\", and \"if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you'd see it in her face.\" Hilson wrote \"Gimme More\" with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, saying: \"I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really.\" Spears began recording with them at the Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas in August, while she was eight months pregnant with Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that \"She gave 150 percent. [...] I don't know any other mother that would do that.\" Danja added that despite all the problems in her personal life, \"As far as her work ethic, I haven't seen anybody come in like that and do what you go to do.\" Regarding the sound of the album, he deemed it as bigger, more mature and \"a new Britney\", explaining: \"I come from hip-hop, so it's underlined with [it], but I throw it down.\"\n\nParagraph 2: In the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of censorship. Their premiere productions of Osborne's A Patriot for Me and Saved by Edward Bond (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a \"private members club\" to circumvent the Lord Chamberlain, formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the Theatres Act 1968. The succès de scandale of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of theatre censorship in the UK. During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Ann Jellicoe and N.F. Simpson. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by Christopher Hampton, Athol Fugard, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels, Errol John, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Sylvia Wynter, Mark Ravenhill, Martin McDonagh, Simon Stephens, Leo Butler, Polly Stenham and Nick Payne. Early seasons included new international plays by Bertolt Brecht, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Marguerite Duras. In addition to the 400-seat proscenium arch Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility.

After celebrating their freedom from the lodge with alcoholism that night they find themselves again captive within the house due to the help of the local inspector who assists Gowri to tackle Manja's unyielding ways. Naani then talks about the plot of his film, which was seemingly ignored by the producer with whom he had placed his trust upon (and for the reason with which he ended up being captive in the lodge). Manja, hearing of the simple story of Dr Rajkumar's pledged eyes and how they were now seeing a world through another person, is taken aback and applauds Naani for such a heartwarming plot and how the -Annavru-'s fans would welcome such a movie. He motivates Naani with all success if Naani ever made the film by taking out his mother's prized 50 rupee note from the cupboard and giving it to Naani. He tells Naani that it was considered as a lucky charm to any person that received it. He also happens to find a note in the cupboard that Gowri leaves behind (after her inability to tell him personally that night due to his inebriated state) to Manja conveying that she was now carrying and that he would soon become a father. Manja's personality suddenly defines a change after reading the news. He is unable to express his joy, apart from sharing it with Naani, at that moment being locked in his home. He tries calling Gowri but he doesn't get her on-line. In the midst of all this, there concocts a life turning situation for Manja at that moment. His wife returns home struck in pain. Gowri had killed the developing child in her womb due to the burdensome worry which she concluded that she wasn't in a state to be able to maintain and grow a child while having such a lackluster and incapable husband. She perceived that it was best for the child to not come to life and face a deteriorated lifestyle. Naani leaves the house expressing his ill-timed presence in the development of such an event. Manja is clipped between a moment of where he faced fresh joy like he had not known for a long long time where he believed that the child, who would be his Lakshmi (the Goddess of wealth), would change his life for the better and to another moment that his 'Lakshmi' would not be happening. In his state of hopelessness, he threatens Gowri as to what rights she held to kill his child. Gowri is throbbing in pain to be able to reply to his questions. In this delusion of Manja, Lakshmi -the unborn child, appears to him and speaks to him as to how ill-fated she would have been to have been born as a daughter to such a father. Lakshmi says that Gowri, her mother, did not kill her and that Manja, her father, killed her and suggests to him that he could celebrate this occasion with his friends by drinking along with them. Manja's remorse knows no bounds. He reflects back Lakshmi's words to Gowri and says to his wife that neither his own parents nor his own wife or any of his gurus could ever be a guru to him, but the unborn dead child which will never happen in his existence was his ultimate guru to his final immediate realization of the value of life.\n\nParagraph 6: In the 20th century stand out Quintero brothers for their Andalusian costumbrist comedies and Carlos Arniches for his pieces from Madrid; the costumbrist element appears as fundamental in the expressionist painter and writer José Gutiérez Solana, one of the few costumbrist writers who doesn’t extol the popular aspects and who shows himself brutally critic in, for example, La España negra (The black Spain) (1920), against  the obliging paintings by Julio Romero de Torres (however, expressionists in essence) or more balanced by Ignacio Zuloaga; nevertheless, since the Civil War, this Costumbrismo involutes as it is identified with the superficial and uncritical picturesqueness of the European travellers to Spain from the 19th century and with an Andalusian (from Andalusia) impoverishing reductionism that was good to the economic necessity of promote the Tourism, especially in the cinema, where this type of products became known as españoladas. Nevertheless, some prewar and postwar authors headed by Ramón Gómez de la Serna (Elucidario de Madrid, El Rastro) (Explanation of Madrid, The Track) are saved because they follow the 19th century tradition of the Sketch of manners. This group revolves around the so-called Madrileñismo (from Madrid), like Eusebio Blasco (1844–1903), Pedro de Répide (1882–1947), Emiliano Ramírez Ángel (1883–1928), Luis Bello or, in the postwar, Federico Carlos Sainz de Robles. As for the Andalucismo (meaning in English Andalusian literary expression), the deep 19th century vein is renewed by writers like José Nogales (1860–1908), Salvador Rueda (1857–1933), Arturo Reyes (1864–1913) and others. The Costumbrismo of the called Generation of ‘98 has more value and shaded dyes, and looks in its trips the real Spain opposite the official Spain: Miguel de Unamuno writes De mi país (From my country) (1903), Pio Baroja his Vitrina pintoresca (Odd display cabinet (1935), receiving in his Basque (from the Basque Country in Spain) trilogies, customs of that region, as in his etchings and literature his brother Ricardo Baroja; Azorín appears to the Castilian (from Castile in Spain) and Andalusian scenery (Los pueblos, Alma española, Madrid.

He apprenticed under Cecil Wood before studying architecture at the University of Auckland, eventually working at the London County Council where he was exposed to British New Brutalism. Upon returning to Christchurch, and forming the practice Warren and Mahoney, he was instrumental in developing the \"Christchurch School\" of architecture, an intersection between the truth-to-materials and structural expression that characterised Brutalism, and the low-key, Scandinavian and Japanese commitment to \"straightforwardness\". He retired from Warren and Mahoney in 1994 but continued to consult as an architect and maintain his historic home and garden at Ohinetahi.\n\nParagraph 8: Finally, on July 4, Jared Scott is beaten by his mother's boyfriend and slips into a coma.  The feeders, however, drive the boyfriend into a craze and he ends up accidentally killing himself.  Pick is captured by the demon, and Nest and John confront him at the site of the maentwrog tree.  While Nest's grandfather stops Derry Howe from injuring anyone at the fireworks show, the demon manages to release the maentwrog.  Through extensive magic use, John is able to defeat the creature, but passes out.  The demon confronts Nest alone and teaches her of her past.  She learns that her grandmother once became friends with the demon and would \"run with him\" instead of fighting against him. At this time, she thought him simply another person, not a demon. The demon tried to seduce her grandmother, but she resisted, and turned to the side of the Word.  In revenge, the demon seduced her daughter, Nest's mother, and she bore him a daughter, Nest.  When Nest's mother found out after Nest was born that he was a demon, she apparently lost her mind and committed suicide.  Now the demon is back for Nest, and by touching her, he can convince her to join the Void.  Wraith appears, but the demon reveals that Wraith is actually a gift from the demon, sent to protect Nest until he could come back and claim her.  Nest holds the demon at bay for a time, but when he is about to lay his hand on her, Wraith turns on the demon and tears him to pieces.  Nest learns from Pick that even though Wraith was created by the demon, her grandmother long ago expended all of her magic to convince Wraith to defend Nest against the demon as well.\n\nParagraph 9: By the late-1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. He said in 1971 that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal,, so he developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.Fritz the Cat was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. While the film is widely noted in its innovation, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the United States. Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children. Because of the perception that Fritz the Cat was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal. Praise from Rolling Stone and The New York Times, and the film's acceptance into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival cleared up previous misconceptions. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with Heavy Traffic. Thanks to Heavy Traffic, Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back. Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta, Canada when it was originally released.\n\nParagraph 10: The two PVA battalions attacking on the Marine right had their greatest success at Boulder City, seizing a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines. In an attempt to exploit this foothold, the PVA attacked the Berlin and East Berlin gates, passages through the wire that the Marines had used to supply and reinforce the two outposts before both were overwhelmed. Cloud cover prevented aerial observers from supporting the troops protecting the gates, and the PVA managed to gain control of Berlin gate and mount a second determined assault on the Boulder City perimeter. Hand-to-hand fighting raged all along the  of trench that Lieutenant Swigart's Marines still held. The company's ammunition ran low, and the plight of casualties became increasingly difficult as PVA fire killed two of Boulder City's eight corpsmen and wounded most of the others. By midnight, Swigart's company could muster no more than half its earlier strength, but it still clung to the rear slope of Boulder City. Casualties had further eroded the strength of the Boulder City garrison, when at 00:15 on the 25th, Company I, 3/1 Marines, moved toward the hill to reinforce Swigart's survivors. The PVA intercepted and correctly interpreted the coded radio message ordering the Company I Marines forward, thus obtaining information that enabled their artillery and mortars to wound or kill about a third of the reinforcements. Despite the deadly barrage, much of Company I reached Boulder City, joined forces with the remnants of Swigart's garrison, and took part in a counterattack that recaptured the hill by 03:30. Further reinforcements from Company E, 2/7 Marines, and Company E, 2/1 Marines, arrived by 05:30 to consolidate the position. A few PVA, however, continued to cling to positions on the slopes nearest the MLR. Since the PVA still controlled the approaches to Boulder City, they were able to mount another attack on that position at 08:20, 25 July. Fire from Marine mortars and artillery, and from the 90mm weapons of 10 tanks dug in on the Marine positions, played the key role in breaking up the new assault, although the last of the attackers did not withdraw until afternoon. The M-46 tanks proved deadly against advancing PVA troops, but also presented an inviting target for PVA artillery and mortar crews, who directed some 2,200 rounds at the armored vehicles. Aircraft also helped repulse the 25 July attack on Boulder City, as when F9F jets flew nine missions, guided by ground radar, against positions threatening Boulder City and nearby defensive strongpoints."}

These programs are designed to make the local population feel secure, safe, and more aligned with the counterinsurgency efforts; this enables the citizens of the host nation to trust the goals and purposes of the counterinsurgency efforts, as opposed to the insurgents'. A counterinsurgency is a battle of ideas and the implementation and integration of these programs is important for success. Social, political and economic programs should be coordinated and administered by the host nation's leaders, as well. Successful COIN warfare allows the population to see that the counterinsurgency efforts are including the host nation in their re-building programs.

The 4 May 1990 declaration of independence (reinstating the 1920 constitution subject to a transitional period) by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR affirmed that the restored Republic of Latvia would base its relations with the Russian Federation on the treaty principle. In January 1991, the Russian Federation (while still in the USSR) and Latvia signed a document regulating their bilateral relations. The Latvian delegation attempted to include a reference to the 1920 treaty but the Russian delegation objected. In essence, Russia views Latvia as a newly independent country and consistently refuses to acknowledge that Latvia was occupied and illegally incorporated into the USSR, while Latvia insists upon the legal continuity of Latvian state occupied in 1940. Key players in post-war politics in the West never recognised or at least questioned the legality of the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR, but there is pressure on both countries to resolve the issue. This can be seen on the example of their attitude towards events from the beginning of the 20th century in Latvia. Thus, the European Community, for example, did not use the term \"recognition\" but referred to \"the restoration of sovereignty and independence\" when restoring diplomatic relations in 1991; the US to \"the culmination of the USA’s 52 year refusal to accept the forcible incorporation of the independent Baltic States by the USSR\". (See, for example, Roland Rich's paper for the Symposium on Recent Developments in State Recognition.). Pressure on the RF includes the need for Russia to have a border agreement in order to pursue a less draconian visa policy from the EU.\n\nParagraph 4: In the 853rd century the institutions of the Justice League of America (JLA) and the Legion of Super-Heroes have developed into the Justice Legions, various teams of superhumans who act to protect the Milky Way galaxy. The highest ranking of these is the Justice Legion Alpha, who have their base on Jupiter and are responsible for protecting the Solar System (the second rank is Justice Legion Beta, the third is Justice Legion Gamma, and so on).  While Alpha resembles the JLA, other legions resemble teams such as the Teen Titans, Young Justice, the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Legion of Super-Pets, etc.\n\nParagraph 5: A day after leaving Bury he was appointed as manager of Port Vale. He replaced club legend Roy Sproson, and was given a large war chest to spend after a successful lottery scheme was set up at Vale Park. He took over with the club in 21st place in the Third Division. His first game in charge was a 0–0 draw with Midland Counties League side Arnold in the First Round of the FA Cup. In January, veteran defender Graham Hawkins was signed as a player-coach from Blackburn Rovers for £6,000. Forward Neville Chamberlain also joined the club as a professional, becoming the club's first black pro. John Froggatt also joined the club, signing from Colchester United for £10,000. Chairman Arthur McPherson celebrated this abandonment of frugality by declaring \"we are going places\". Local journalist Chris Harper slated the board for their decisions, calling them 'berserk'. Froggatt scored fifteen seconds into his debut in a 4–0 win over Exeter City. However this would be as good as it got for both Froggatt and Vale that season. In February, Vale beat Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a friendly, but also started a five games sequence without a win. Ged Stenson arrived the next month from Everton for a 'bargain' £3,000, and John Lumsdon joined on loan from Stoke City. Vale improved, and were unbeaten in six of their seven March games, with Chamberlain scoring on his debut. Yet on 28 March they started a club-record streak of twelve home games without a win that would continue into the following season. Encouragement came from the youth side, who reached the Quarter Finals of the FA Youth Cup. With four games to go, Vale were one point clear of the drop, however by losing all of their remaining games the \"Valiants\" ended the 1977–78 season in 21st place and were relegated into the Fourth Division. Smith was appointed as manager of Swindon Town in May 1978, with the club having to pay a compensation fee of £10,500 to Port Vale. His assistant, Dennis Butler, stayed on at the club and was appointed as his successor.\n\nParagraph 6: Zacharie Robutel de La Noue (June 4, 1665 – 1733) was a French lieutenant and captain in the colonial regular troops, and seigneur of Châteauguay. Robutel de La Noue was a Canadian, born in Montreal, son of Claude Robutel de La Noue, seigneur of Île Saint-Paul, and Suzanne de Gabrielle. As a soldier he escorted various expeditions - to Hudson Bay in 1686 with Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes and up the Ottawa River in 1692. He also led military attacks on Mohawk villages in 1692–93. He was sent by governor Vaudreuil in July 1717 to establish a chain of three posts from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods, but he was only able to re-establish a fur trading post, Fort Kaministiquia, on the Kaministiquia River. He remained there as commandant until 1721.\n\nParagraph 7: On September 26, 2011, Chait, while admitting he had not read Gilad Atzmon's book The Wandering Who, in order to assess the context of a number of quotes, responded to John Mearsheimer's comment about Atzmon's book by citing passages which he regarded as characteristically anti-semitic. On January 27, 2015, Chait wrote an article for New York magazine on political correctness, which he labeled \"a system of left-wing ideological repression\" and cited examples from academia and social media. Chait's piece drew parallels between forms of political correctness popular in the 2010s with those popular in the 1990s. However, he also argued that the advent of social media had contributed to a form of political correctness that was more ubiquitous and less constrained to academia.\n\nParagraph 8: Among listed sites in Maryland was the campus of the former Navy Ordnance Laboratory which was listed by the US Navy as a hazardous waste site which may have harbored radioactive materials related to nuclear weapons development.

Moussaoui had been suspected of being involved in preparations for a suicide-hijacking similar to the December 1994 \"Eiffel Tower\" hijacking of Air France 8969. Failures identified by Rowley may have left the U.S. vulnerable to the September 11, 2001, attacks.

He ran the mental health department of a federally-funded Community Health Center which he eventually expanded into the first free-standing community mental health center in Georgia. He also continued to play an active role in the integration efforts in Georgia and the South. Together with his first wife, Judith Rooks, Bourne led an effort to overturn Georgia's restrictive abortion laws. Having failed in the state legislature, together with other plaintiffs, they filed suit against the state on behalf of Jane Doe, a patient seeking an abortion for whom Bourne was the physician of record. Following victories for the plaintiffs in the state courts the case, as Doe vs Bolton, was appealed to the Supreme Court of the US. It was heard together with the better known case from Texas, Roe vs Wade. The court's watershed ruling based on the two cases transformed women's access to abortion in the US.

Fleury & Co. On 7 January 1897, Kilburn & Co secured the Calcutta electric lighting license as agents of the Indian Electric Co, which was registered in London on 15 January 1897. A month later, the company was renamed the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation. The control of the company was transferred from London to Calcutta only in 1970. The introduction of electricity in Calcutta was a success, and power was next introduced in Bombay (now Mumbai). The first electric lighting demonstration in Mumbai was in 1882 at Crawford Market and the Bombay Electric Supply & Tramways Company (BEST) set up a generating station in 1905 to provide electricity for the tramway.\n\nParagraph 7: Models Inc. is the third series in the Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise, and a direct spin-off of Melrose Place. In its second season (1993–94), Melrose Place was one of Fox's highest-rated shows, and had been called \"arguably the hottest one-hour drama on television\". In December 1993, Fox announced plans for a Melrose Place spin-off called Models Inc., set in a Los Angeles modeling agency. Spelling said, \"[Fox] asked if we would do an eight-hour series. And we came up with Models.\" He initially explained that the series would center on Melrose Place character Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga), and that two models would move into the titular apartment complex on Melrose Place before being transplanted into the new series. Entertainment Weekly also reported that the estranged mother of Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear) would be introduced on Melrose Place to  eventually lead Models Inc., and Locklear would not be headlining the new series as previously reported. Darren Star, the creator of both Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place, was not involved with Models Inc., which was created by Charles Pratt Jr. and Frank South, and executive produced by Aaron Spelling, Pratt, South, and E. Duke Vincent. Star said of the potential series, \"It was one spin-off too many for me\", though Spelling noted, \"No one even thinks of Melrose as a spin-off anymore.\"\n\nParagraph 8: GoodTimes began with the distribution of copies of public domain titles. Though the company also produced and distributed many low-priced fitness videos, its most recognized line of products were the series of low-budget traditionally animated films from companies such as Jetlag Productions, Golden Films, and Blye Migicovsky Productions, as well as a selection of the works of Burbank Films Australia. Many of its home-video titles—such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, Sinbad, The Little Mermaid, The Three Musketeers and Thumbelina—were named similarly or identically to big-budget animated films from other studios (though their plots were sometimes very different), and GoodTimes would often release these films close to the theatrical/home-video releases of other studios. This was largely legal, as the stories of the big-budget films were based on folk tales that had long been in the public domain, and the major studios had little room to claim exclusive rights to the stories or the main characters. The Walt Disney Company sued GoodTimes in 1993 because the videotape packaging closely resembled Disney's, allegedly creating the potential of confusing consumers into unintentionally purchasing a GoodTimes title, when they instead meant to purchase a film from Disney. As a result of this lawsuit, GoodTimes was required by law to print its name atop all of its future VHS covers, in order to clearly demonstrate to the public at large that this was not the \"blockbuster\" title that they would be purchasing. Despite these changes, however, GoodTimes continued to produce animated films based on public domain \"knockoff\" titles. At the Summer CES 1985, GoodTimes launched a home video label Kids Klassics Home Video, which was specifically designed for a children's audience. The first Kids Klassics videos were 52 different cartoons, which were all meant to be in color and received a 50-50 joint venture with Remco to market the Mel-O-Toons cartoons by Storer Broadcasting. The company made its first licensed client in 1986, by signing a deal with Worldvision Home Video to reissue titles on videocassette, through the Kids Klassics label, which was mostly on Hanna-Barbera cartoons. This was followed in 1987 by signing a deal with major video distributor MCA Home Video to license these titles to videocassette, mainly the Universal Pictures catalog for a price of $15. That year, Goodtimes and Kids Klassics merged their distribution arms to form Goodtimes/Kids Klassics Distribution Corp. In the 1990s they expanded the company into GT Publishing, a division of the company that published children's books under the Inchworm Press imprint. Expanding from home video distribution, GoodTimes founded its spin-off, GT Interactive as a way to distribute video games. This company was sold to the French game publisher Infogrames in 1999. At different times, GoodTimes contracted with Columbia Pictures, NBC, HBO, Worldvision Enterprises, Hanna-Barbera, Orion Home Video, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures to release inexpensive tapes of many of their films and TV series. In addition, GoodTimes released several compilations assembled from public domain films, film trailers, earlier television programs and newsreels. Most of these were credited to Film Shows, Inc. In July 2005, GoodTimes filed for bankruptcy and its assets were then sold to Gaiam. Despite its closure in 2005, GoodTimes Entertainment produced at that time a TV series called Wulin Warriors. The series was an edited version of Pili, produced by Broadway Video and Animation Collective for Cartoon Network's Toonami block in 2006. It was pulled after two episodes aired, due to poor ratings and complaints. Gaiam later started a division called GT Media, which served as a general-interest label that released films and non-exercise videos such as animated films from DIC Entertainment and mockbusters from The Asylum. It was later folded into its parent company. Gaiam then spun off its home video assets to Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment in 2012, which in turn was sold and merged into New Video in 2013.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1988, Harold's sister, Hester Samuels (Barbara Shelley), comes to Walford to visit and tells him that her son, David (Christopher Reich), is interested in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks it is a great idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made a partner in the practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of multiple sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and anemic. This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.\n\nParagraph 10: When Félix Gallardo was arrested, Guzmán reportedly lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco for some time. One of his other centers of operation, however, was in the border city of Agua Prieta, Sonora, where he coordinated drug trafficking activities more closely. Guzmán had dozens of properties in various parts of the country. People he trusted purchased the properties for him and registered them under false names. Most of them were located in residential neighborhoods and served as stash houses for drugs, weapons, and cash. Guzmán also owned several ranches across Mexico, but most of them were located in the states of Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, and Sonora, where locals working for the drug lord grew opium and marijuana. The first time Guzmán was detected by U.S. authorities for his involvement in organized crime was in 1987, when several protected witnesses testified in a U.S. court that Guzmán was in fact heading the Sinaloa Cartel. An indictment issued in the state of Arizona alleged that Guzmán had coordinated the shipment of  of marijuana and about  of cocaine from 19 October 1987 to 18 May 1990, and had received roughly US$1.5 million in drug proceeds that were shipped back to his home state. Another indictment alleged that Guzmán earned US$100,000 for trafficking  of cocaine and an unspecified amount of marijuana in a period of three years. In the border areas between Tecate and San Luis Río Colorado, Guzmán ordered his men to traffic most of the drugs overland, but also through a few aircraft. By using the so-called piecemeal strategy, in which traffickers kept drug quantities relatively low, risks were reduced. Guzmán also pioneered the use of sophisticated tunnels to move drugs across the border and into the United States. Aside from pioneering the tunnels, Palma and Guzmán packed cocaine into chili pepper cans under the brand \"La Comadre\" before they were shipped to the U.S. by train. In return, the drug lords were paid through large suitcases filled with millions of dollars in cash. These suitcases were flown from the U.S. to Mexico City, where corrupt customs agents at the airport made sure the deliveries were not inspected. Large sums of that money were reportedly used as bribes for members of the Attorney General's Office."}

The novel consists of two parts: a detective story and an unpublished manuscript written by a murder victim. The manuscript tells the story of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, who embarks on a journey to understand religious ideologies across the ancient world. He concludes that these beliefs are influenced by political intrigue and the fears of the people. Ahasuerus later meets Jesus and challenges him on the laws and promises of Yahweh. The manuscript provides clues to solve the murder of its author, Min Yoseop. Both Yoseop and Ahasuerus are consumed by their philosophical ideals, and the tragic outcome reflects the author's pessimism about people's ability to save themselves.

The work consists of two novels, a detective story and the unpublished manuscript of a novel written by the victim of a murder. The latter, the inner story and core of the work, imagines the character of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew. In the first half of the story, Ahasuerus leaves his home in Judea and embarks on a quest to understand the meanings of religious ideologies from across the ancient world. As described in a Korean Literature Now review, his travels to the centers of religious thought lead him to conclude that all were the product of \"political intrigue and the base desires of a frightened populace\" In the second half of the story, he returns to his homeland. He undertakes a fast in the desert where he meets the Great Spirit, an opponent of the Jewish god, Yahweh. In an alternate telling of the gospel story of the Temptation of Jesus, he also finds Jesus, who is similarly fasting, and attempts to convince him of the unreasonableness of the laws of Yahweh, with respect to free will, human suffering and punishment for sin. Ahasuerus petitions Jesus to turn rocks into bread to feed a suffering humanity, to no avail. A similar confrontation occurs when Jesus is giving the Sermon on the Mount, when Ahasuerus accuses Jesus of offering \"empty promises of paradise\". Finally, he meets Jesus on his way to Calvary and refuses to aid him. This act leads him to be sentenced to wander the earth forever, a fate which allows him to continue his search for truth. The unpublished manuscript of the novel was written by a former theology student, Min Yoseop, who has been murdered. He left seminary, disillusioned by the perceived hypocrisy he found there and, together with a devoted follower, attempts to relieve the suffering of downtrodden Koreans (so prevalent after the Korean war) in a more direct way. The text of the manuscript provides clues to solving the murder. There are strong parallels between Min Yoseop and Ahasuerus, both of whom are consumed by their philosophical ideals. The tragic outcome was considered an expression of Yi's pessimism concerning the ability of people to save themselves.  Brother Anthony, who translated this work, noted that, in his view, the work represents criticism of Protestant Christianity in South Korea after the Korean war. At the time, some pastors preyed on the vulnerability of their parishioners for their own economic advantage. He suggested that Yi's views may have been influenced by his upbringing which was steeped in Confucianism. The work has been revised several times, most recently in 2020. In an interview that was conducted while that revision was underway, Yi stated that when the original book was published, the Korean public had very little knowledge of comparative religion and he believed that his work helped to fill that void. It was well documented with 335 footnotes, although these were not included in the English translation.  An academic review concluded that it was derived from apocrypha, Gnosticism and the perspective of Korean Minjung theology (literally the peoples' theology).\n\nParagraph 2: Carl Daniel Peterson was born on May 26, 1943, in the Swedish Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the third of four sons born to Louise and Eric Peterson. His father worked heavy construction jobs throughout the Midwest, helping to build various military sites in the throes of World War II. When Carl was not yet four years old, the family moved to Long Beach, California, where Eric began a construction business with his brother-in-law. Carl attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, participating in football and baseball for the Wilson Bruins. It was there that the first steps on his future were written with the help of football coach Skip Rowland. Peterson played end, doing more blocking than catching, and also kicked extra points in a straight-on style. He was part of the graduating class of 1961 at Wilson and went on to earn three degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA): a bachelor's degree in 1966, a master's degree in 1967, and a doctorate in 1970. His football playing career ended during a practice at UCLA (where he was a walk-on participant), when he suffered three torn knee ligaments. His coaching career began soon afterwards, at his alma mater, where he helped Rowland with the varsity and coached the junior-varsity team. He moved on to Loyola High School in Los Angeles, where he coached the offensive line for head coach Mario DiMuro, and also taught classes in math, geometry, trigonometry and health sciences. In 1969, he applied for and was hired at a new college - California State Sonoma—now known as Sonoma State University—in the Santa Rosa/Rohnert Park, California area. It was one of 18 California state universities. He was hired as the head baseball coach and an assistant under head football coach Lloyd Helgeson. Sonoma State competed the junior varsity level in 1969. Peterson succeeded Helgeson as head coach in 1970 when Sonoma State moved up to varsity status, competing at the NCAA College Division level. He led Sonoma State to a record of 6–12–1 in two seasons, 1970 and 1971, before the school disbanded its football program in 1972. Peterson left Sonoma State in February 1973 to become an assistant football coach at UCLA under head coach Pepper Rodgers. When Dick Vermeil took over as head coach of the UCLA Bruins in 1974, he retained Peterson on his coaching staff that eventually led UCLA to a Rose Bowl upset over head coach Woody Hayes' No. 1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on January 1, 1976.\n\nParagraph 3:  Institute of Business Administration (E Unit)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Jahangirnagar University (IBA-JU) started as the university's Department of Business Administration (DBA) in 1991.

Fiona \"Tosh\" Mackintosh (Rebecca Scroggs) later moves in and shocks him when he learns that she is in a relationship with Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). Later, Roxy discovers that Ronnie paid Aleks and they have an argument but they stay together. Then, Aleks' young daughter, Ineta (Octavia Alexandru) talks to him over video chat, asking if he is coming home. Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) becomes suspicious when he finds Aleks talking to somebody over the Internet in Latvian and he angrily throws Alfie out. Alfie enlists Tamwar's help to hack into Aleks' laptop and see what he is hiding, and Tamwar tells Alfie that he has been contacting his wife. Alfie and Tamwar tell Roxy but she does not believe him, choosing instead to ask Tamwar about Alfie's discovery and he shows her the evidence. Later on, Roxy cooks Aleks a romantic meal and asks about his wife. He reveals he has a daughter, Ineta, and that he is married to Ineta's mother but they are separated. Roxy then throws Aleks out and buys him a plane tickets to Latvia but as he is about to leave, Roxy stops him, saying that she still wants to be with him. Aleks later nearly comes to blows with Alfie after he makes remarks about Aleks' marital status and later gives Alfie's pitch to rival market trader Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), despite Alfie excusing his absence on the day to illness, causing further tension between them. Roxy asks Aleks to show his commitment to her and he arranges a surprise holiday, proving to Roxy that he's committed and avoiding his wife Marta (Noeleen Comiskey) and their daughter who have arrived from Latvia. Aleks has sex with Marta in his office. Ronnie's partner, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), sees him and demands he tells Roxy, but Marta does before he can. She is devastated and throws him out; however, she realises her feelings for him are too strong and invites him to move back in. Marta goes home but leaves Ineta with Aleks, believing she will be better off in England. Aleks supports Charlie after the traumatic birth of his son Matthew following a car crash and, inspired by Dot, suggests the name Matthew. Charlie's wife, Ronnie, goes into a coma after Matthew's birth. Aleks learns that Roxy and Charlie have slept together so he goes to the hospital to tell Ronnie but cannot bring himself to do so.\n\nParagraph 5: The idea of having the oil company negotiate directly with the interior of Oman was not favored by the British Political Agent who resided in Muscat providing the justification that it would mean recognizing the authority of the Imamate and it would increase its prestige- which would not favor IPC deal. The British Political Agent believed that the only method of granting the oil company access to the interior was by assisting the sultan in occupying the Imamate. The position of the British government was thereafter to eliminate any possibility of entering into direct relations with the interior in order not to alienate the sultan and to avoid invalidating the claim of IPC that its concession from the sultan covers the entirety of Oman. In 1946, the British government provided arms and ammunition, auxiliary supplies and officers to occupy the interior.  In September 1946, the British government studied the proposal that was promised to the sultan of using the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to occupy the interior. The British government concluded that it is reluctant \"in principle\" to the use of force for the reason of avoiding international criticism that may lead to the calling of the British government before the United Nations Security Council but they executed anyway waging war for over 5 years between the two Head of Estate on the battle ground Jabel Akhdar (The Green Mountain) with over 2,000 martyrs losing their lives. Meanwhile, the British government recognized that the use of RAF would expedite oil exploration operations in the interior of Oman.\n\nParagraph 6: As New England's urban, industrial economy transformed from the beginning of the early national period (~1790) to the middle of the nineteenth century, so too did its agricultural economy. At the beginning of this period, when the United States was just emerging from its colonial past, the agricultural landscape of New England was defined overwhelmingly by subsistence farming.  The primary crops produced were wheat, barley, rye, oats, turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions, cucumbers, beets, corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and melons.  Because there was not a sufficiently large New England-based home market for agricultural products due to the absence of a large nonagricultural population, New England farmers, by and large, had no incentive to commercialize their farms.  Thus, as farmers could not find very many markets nearby to sell to, they generally could not earn enough income with which to buy many new products for themselves. This not only meant that farmers would largely produce their own food, but also that they tended to produce their own furniture, clothing, and soap, among other household items.  Hence, according to historian Percy Bidwell, at the onset of the early national period, much of the New England agricultural economy was characterized by a “lack of exchange; lack of differentiation of employments or division of labor; the absence of progress in agricultural methods; a relatively low standard of living; emigration and social stagnation.”  As Bidwell writes, the farming in New England at this time was “practically uniform” with many farmers distributing their land “in about the same proportions into pasturage, woodland, and tillage, and raised about the same crops and kept about the same kind and quantity of stock” as other farmers.  This situation would, however, be radically different by 1850, by which time a highly specialized agricultural economy producing a host of new and differentiated products had emerged. Two factors were primarily responsible for the revolutionary changes in the agricultural economy of New England during the period from 1790 to 1850: (1) The rise of the manufacturing industry in New England (industrialization), and (2) agricultural competition from the western states.\n\nParagraph 7: The movement was caused by Premier Zhou Enlai's death on 8 January 1976 and the Qingming festival on April 5 that year. The Gang of Four, anticipating that people would use the Qingming festival to commemorate Zhou's death, as many felt he had not been properly honored immediately after his death. On March 25, the Shanghai newspaper Wenhui Bao, controlled by the Gang of Four, published an article criticizing Deng Xiaoping, with implied attacks on Zhou as Deng's \"backer\", for capitalist ideas. This resulted in large crowds of protesters, including former Red Guards, surrounding the newspaper's offices. In Nanjing, similar protests spread from Nanjing University to the city streets, with people carrying wreaths to the Yuhuatai Memorial. Gang of Four supporters later removed the wreaths and suppressed news of the protest in official media channels, but news still spread to other cities. In response to the protests, Deng was criticized at a Politburo meeting for leading capitalists and attempting to seize power.\n\nParagraph 8: Due to the cancellation of the 2020 CFL season, Collaros did not play in 2020. He entered the 2021 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season as the undisputed starter and completed 18 of 28 pass attempts for 217 yards and two touchdowns in the season-opening Grey Cup rematch against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He threw for a season-high 417 yards, the second highest of his career, and two touchdowns in a week 9 win over the BC Lions on October 1, 2021. The Blue Bombers clinched first place in the league in week 12 with three games remaining as Collaros had a 10–1 record as the team's starting quarterback. He finished the season having played and started in 13 regular season games, completing 243 passes out of 346 attempts for 3,185 yards, 20 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He had a 111.01 quarterback passer rating, which at the time was the 10th-best single season rating in CFL history. For his dominant year, he was named a CFL All-Star and the CFL's Most Outstanding Player. In Winnipeg's first West Final playoff game since 1972, Collaros completed 17 out of 21 pass attempts for 229 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions in the victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He then started in his third career Grey Cup game in the 108th Grey Cup championship, which was once again against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Collaros completed 21 of 32 pass attempts for 240 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 33–25 overtime victory over the Tiger-Cats and he was named the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player. On January 20, 2022, Collaros and the Blue Bombers agreed to a one-year contract extension. Collaros continued his impressive play into the 2022 season leading the Bombers to a second consecutive first place finish in the Western Division. With three weeks remaining in the season, and a first-round bye already secured, the Bombers began resting Collaros for the playoffs. On October 18, 2022, the Bombers announced they had signed Collaros to a three-year contract extension, keeping him with the club through 2025. He ended the season leading the league in touchdown passes with 37 and highest touchdown rate (8.49%). His 116.20 quarterback passer rating, was the 4th-best single season rating in CFL history and he won his second consecutive CFL's Most Outstanding Player award. In the playoffs Collaros helped lead the Bombers to their third consecutive Grey Cup appearance where they were favored against the underdog Toronto Argo's. Hoping to become the first team in 40 years to win three consecutive Grey Cups, the Bombers lead 23-14 by the start of the 4th quarter. Unfortunately for Collaros they were ultimately upset by the Argo's who prevailed with a score of 24-23. Collaros played poorly in the game completing only 14 out of 23 pass attempts for 183 yards, one interception and no touchdowns, his worst performance of the season.\n\nParagraph 9: At the very beginning the scene where Lisa waves at Bart as he can't get on the bus is a reference to The French Connection. The sequence of Bart crashing down the stairwell to the Mafia bar is similar to a scene in the film Goodfellas and \"A Bronx Tale\", in which a young boy is employed by a Mafia as their messenger. All the horses in the race that Bart bets on are named after a famous animated character's catchphrase: \"Ain't I a Stinker?\" (Bugs Bunny), \"Yabba Dabba Doo\" (Fred Flintstone), \"Sufferin' Succotash\" (Sylvester the Cat), \"That's All Folks\" (Porky Pig), \"I Yam What I Yam\" (Popeye), and Bart's own \"Eat my shorts\" and \"Don't have a cow\". The Chiffons's song \"One Fine Day\" is heard when Bart serves drinks to the mobsters during a game of poker. The writers originally wanted to use the song \"Be My Baby\" by The Ronettes for the scene, but they could not clear the copyrights for it. In his room, Bart stores the Springfield Mafia's loot—a truckload of cartons of Laramie cigarettes. While strutting around the kitchen, he sings Frank Sinatra's song \"Witchcraft\". The scene in which Bart wakes up screaming after having a nightmare about Skinner is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz screams after waking up in bed and finding a decapitated horse head by his side. Fat Tony receiving \"the Kiss of Death\" from a mobster for serving a substandard Manhattan is a parody of Michael Corleone kissing his brother Fredo after discovering his betrayal in The Godfather Part II (1974). When Legs testifies against Bart in court, a chart of photographs displays Bart as the head of a crime family, reminiscent of the chart displaying \"The Michael Corleone Family\" during the Senate Hearing Committee sequences in The Godfather Part II. Skinner frees himself from being trapped under the newspapers in a way similar to the character Angus MacGyver's escapes in the American television series MacGyver.\n\nParagraph 10: This category was created to differentiate between British nationals with strong ties to the United Kingdom and those connected only with an overseas territory (other than Gibraltar or the Falkland Islands), both of which groups had shared Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) before 1 January 1983. The primary right of citizenship, that of abode in the United Kingdom, had been involuntarily taken away from colonial CUKCs by 1968 and 1971 Acts of Parliament, unless they retained it through a qualifying connection with the United Kingdom. Under the British Nationality Act 1981, which went into effect on 1 January 1983, colonial CUKCs (other than Gibraltarians and Falkland Islanders) without a qualifying connection to the United Kingdom became British Dependent Territories citizens (renamed British Overseas Territories citizenship in 2002), a citizenship which did not include right of abode anywhere; not even in the territories in which they were born (CUKCs born in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, or the Crown Dependencies of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man all became British Citizens, with right of abode in the United Kingdom). Those with British Overseas Territories citizenship remained British nationals (subject to British sovereignty), but not British citizens (although British Dependent Territories Citizenship or British Overseas Territories Citizenship is a class of British citizenship, stripped of the most basic citizenship rights, not a citizenship of a British Overseas Territory or of the British Overseas Territories collectively as the name was intended to imply). As the United Kingdom is a Commonwealth Realm, all British Nationals, including BDTCs, remained Commonwealth citizens, though free movement by citizens of other Commonwealth countries into the United Kingdom had ended with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 (the British Overseas Territories are not members of the Commonwealth in their own rights, as it is a community of independent nations, one of which is the United Kingdom)."}

Reigning champions Glen Rovers provided the opposition and, after dominating the first half, held a 1-8 to 0-6 interval lead. Horgan had an outstanding second half and scored a trademark point from a 70-yards free. Blackrock held a point lead from the 55th minute and survived two Glen Rovers raids before securing a 2-12 to 2-10 victory. It was Horgan's second county championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents as Blackrock reached another Munster final. There were never more than a few points between the teams throughout the match, with Newmarket spurning a goal chance just before the interval. Blackrock held out for a narrow 1-13 to 0-14 victory and Horgan collected a second winners' medal. The All-Ireland final on 17 March 1974 saw Blackrock and Rathnure renew their rivalry once again. Dan Quigley netted the first goal for Rathnure, however, Éamonn O'Donoghue secured Blackrock's first goal seconds later when he kicked the sliotar over the goal-line. Half-time saw the sides retire having scored 1-7 apiece. Donie Collins put Blackrock ahead early in the second half, however, Quigley soon scored his second to restore parity. A ten-minute period of dominance by Blackrock yielded only three points, while Quigley completed his hat-trick with a goal from a 21-yards free to give Rathnure a one-point lead. Pat Moylan secured the equaliser. The replay on 28 April 1974 produced a tension-charged climax as Blackrock turned almost certain defeat into victory. The first half saw a number of unsavoury incidents, with John O'Halloran (Blackrock) and Mick Mooney (Rathnure) becoming the first players ever to be sent off in an All-Ireland club final. As the game entered stoppage time, Rathnure held a one-point lead. Blackrock's Donie Collins sent in a ground shot which goalkeeper Michael Foley let slip through his legs. Éamonn O'Donoghue secured the victory with a goal in the second minute of injury time. The 3-8 to 1-9 victory gave Horgan a second All-Ireland medal as captain.\n\nParagraph 4: Kim, who has bonded even more with Glanville, heads to Glanville's house to help pack. Later the pair dress up to spy of Glanville's ex. Kim and Foster, who have also become closer, meet to ride horses. Kim opens up about her ex-husband, who is still her best friend, revealing he isn't well. Kim then takes her daughter, Brooke, wedding dress shopping and later celebrates her wedding day. Kim heads up the coast to Santa Barbara for a relaxing spa day they may end up comprising her sobriety. During a Poker night at Davidson's home Kim displays some erratic behavior that has everyone worried, especially her sister Kyle. After Kyle's questioning, it leads to an explosive argument with Glanville escorting Kim away from the house. Kim is admitted to hospital after not feeling well and having a cough. It turns out she has a broken rib, and the night of the poker party she took something for the pain. She is released from hospital and is visited by Kyle and Glanville at separate times and finds herself in a game of she-said-she-said. At Kyle's gay mixer, Kim is put in the middle of Kyle and Glanville's argument and her struggle with her sobriety is revealed and she is left taking Glanville's side and claims she is defending herself. Kim attends a lunch with Kyle that is mediated by Davidson in attempts to move forward, but Kim insists that Kyle doesn't care enough to keep things private. On the way to Amsterdam, Kim confronts Rinna on her recent conversation with Glanville insinuating that Kim has relapsed. While in Amsterdam, Kim feels attacked by both Davidson and Rinna. She calls them out on their judgment which results in to an explosive argument. Kim insinuates Rinna has an eating disorder and brings up Rinna's husband which provokes Rinna into smashing a wine glass. Kim meets with Kyle in Palm Springs where Kyle addressing the issue of Glanville. Kyle claims Glanville is speaking about Kim's sobriety negatively but Kim believes Kyle is lying. Kim later requests answers from Glanville and ends up believing her over her sister. During the reunion part three, Kim admitted to taking one of her ex-husband's pills. She claims she hasn't slipped or relapsed. After the reunion, Kim appeared on a Dr. Phil special discussing her relapse and recent drunken arrest admitting that she drank while the series was airing and prior to the reunion. Her son revealed that she also takes pills and smokes pot.\n\nParagraph 5: James later wakes up in a house on a couch. A man named Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) demands to know who he and his friends are. Having previously experience with lying, he tells Horace his name is Jim LaFleur and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island while on its way to Tahiti. Horace, believing his story, tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that James and his friends must be on it. James asks if he could search for his \"other friends,\" but his plea is denied. It appears Horace and Amy are part of the DHARMA Initiative. Later that night, Richard Alpert enters the Barracks, DHARMA's homes, to demand where his two men, the ones James and Juliet killed, are buried. James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to Richard alone. He explains to Richard he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with John Locke, who had met Richard a few years prior during an earlier flash. He gives the flustered Richard information able to fully convince the latter. James also tells Richard that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense; Richard however tells him his people are livid and want some justice; Amy agrees to give Richard the body of Paul, her husband, in order to keep the truce. The agreement is made; Richard leaves. It appears the present time is 1974, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative's presence on the Island. Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce, stating they must respect their own privacy on the Island. A relieved and obliged Horace kindly informs James he and his fellow survivors can stay on the Island for two more weeks in order to search for his friends (Locke), before boarding the next submarine off the Island. James and Juliet share a quiet moment at the dock, the latter telling the former her longing to leave the Island is at its peak. She wants to leave on the next submarine, but James reminds her she has nothing to go back to, since they are thirty years back. Juliet consents to staying.\n\nParagraph 6: On the day of the primary, delegates gathered in Eagle Square, Abuja to be accredited and vote. The early part of the exercise was beset by logistical issues as there were significant delays in both delegate and journalist accreditation along with the deployment of tear gas by security to disperse crowds. Meanwhile, inside the Square, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission personnel took positions to prevent bribery before candidates gave their final speeches to the delegates before voting. During these speeches, six candidates—Godswill Akpabio, Ibikunle Amosun, Dimeji Bankole, Robert Ajayi Boroffice, Fayemi, and Uju Kennedy Ohanenye—stepped down in favour of Tinubu and one aspirant—Nicholas Felix—withdrew for Osinbajo while the remaining candidates issued promises and proposals for their prospective campaigns. After the candidate's speeches and an address by Buhari, voting began in the early morning of 8 June and after hours of voting, votes were publicly tabulated. When collation was completed, Bola Tinubu emerged as nominee after results showed him winning 60% of the votes with a margin of 45% over runner-up Amaechi. In his acceptance speech, Tinubu thanked his team while striking a conciliatory tone in regards to his former opponents. Post-primary analysis noted multiple potential reasons for Tinubu's victory, namely: other candidates' focus on a Buhari endorsement that never came, the failure of Buhari's succession plan, bribery, and the last-minute withdrawals. The week after the primary were based around the search for Tinubu's running mate, as Tinubu is a southern Muslim it was expected that his running mate would be a northern Christian but controversy emerged as some prominent APC politicians stated their openness to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. As the deadline neared, the party submitted the name of Kabir Ibrahim Masari—a politician and party operative from Katsina State—as a placeholder vice presidential nominee to be substituted at a later date. On 10 July, Ibrahim Masari withdrew and Tinubu announced Kashim Shettima—a senator and former Governor of Borno State—as his running mate after a meeting with Buhari in Daura. Breaking the anti-same religion ticket convention, Tinubu argued in a statement that \"religion...cannot always and fully determine our path\" and that he picked \"the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation\" and compared the ticket to the last Yoruba Muslim-Kanuri Muslim ticket, the successful M. K. O. Abiola-Baba Gana Kingibe slate in 1993. Opponents, like the Christian Association of Nigeria and civil society groups, derided the pick as divisive in a trying time for Nigerian unity. Analysts noted the previous reports from before Tinubu was nominated that said his inner circle did not think a Northern Christian would help the party in the majority-Muslim states and thus a fellow Muslim should be picked.\n\nParagraph 7: Born Pierre Jules Louis Laudenbach, he was encouraged by his uncle, actor Claude Garry, to pursue a career in theater and film. He joined the company at what later was the Théatre de Paris, only to shortly after at the Conservatoire, becoming a pensionnaire of the Comédie-Française in early 1915, returning to it after three years military service in 1919. Before his departure from the Comédie-Française in 1926 Fresnay had played 80 parts in Paris, excelling especially in the works of Alfred de Musset. After playing small roles, in 1915 he was engaged as a pensionnaire without taking an audition at the Comédie-Française, moving up to Mario in Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard and the title role in Britannicus. After the armistice he appeared as Clitandre in Les Femmes savantes, as well as other juvenile leads. These included Perdican (On ne badine pas avec l'amour by Musset), Valentin (Il ne faut jurer de rien by Musset, which he also directed), Fortunio (Le Chandelier by Musset). Alongside contemporary creations, his Comédie-Française career continued with Chatterton (Vigny), becoming a valued member of the troupe due to his intelligent acting, the flexibility of his talent, and quality of his diction (\"l'intelligence de son jeu, la souplesse de son talent et l'excellence de sa diction\"). Upon leaving the Comédie-Française his stage work was found at the Variétés in Guitry plays, then as Marius in the Pagnol trilogy.\n\nParagraph 8: When he met Blunderbore at the top of the icy mountains in the northland, the two battled with Justin eventually winning and killing Blunderbore. Before he died, Blunderbore caused in vain an avalanche that buried Sir Justin and Winged Victory. Neither of them died, but instead were frozen in suspended animation. In our day, Justin and Victory were discovered and released from suspended animation by a museum curator. Realizing he must now live in the modern world, he decided to fight crime and evil with his skills as a knight, called by everybody the Shining Knight and soon took the civilian alias of Justin Arthur. He eventually met heroes like Crimson Avenger and Vigilante and, after meeting other heroes, they formed the Seven Soldiers of Victory. Later, Justin was invited to join the All-Star Squadron. When the JSA and the Squadron were captured by the time travelling villain Per Degaton, who was planning to change the events of Pearl Harbor to conquer the World, he was able to free himself using his sword, which assisted in the defeat of Degaton, though when Degaton went back to future these events were forgotten. Later, Sir Justin returned to  Britain where he served as the personal bodyguard to Sir Winston Churchill during the war in golden age, meanwhile in bronze age or modern age he served as the personal bodyguard to Queen Elizabeth II, and in same time is called by Merlin for some missions asked by King Arthur and Camelot. During his career as a superhero, he met a boy who looked up to him and vowed to be his sidekick, taking the name Squire.\n\nParagraph 9: An early example of Italian literature is the tradition of vernacular lyric poetry performed in Occitan, which reached Italy by the end of the 12th century. In 1230, the Sicilian School became notable for being the first style in standard Italian. Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest of Italian poets, is notable for being the author of La Divina Commedia (The Divine Comedy,  1308–1320). Renaissance humanism developed during the 14th and the beginning of the 15th centuries; Italian humanists sought to create a citizenry able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity. Early Italian humanists, such as the lyric poet Francesco Petrarca and the Neoplatonist philosopher Marsilio Ficino, were erudite Classical scholars and great collectors of antique manuscripts. The Italian nobleman, statesman, and mecenate Lorenzo de Medici is regarded as the standard bearer of the influence of Florence on the Renaissance in the Italian states. The Italian polymath, scientist, and artist Leonardo da Vinci wrote a treatise on painting. The development of the drama in the 15th century was very great. In the 16th century, the fundamental characteristic of the era following the end of the Renaissance is that it perfected the Italian character of its language. Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini were the chief originators of the science of history. Pietro Bembo was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language and an influence on the 16th-century revival of interest in the works of Petrarca.\n\nParagraph 10:  Having once been marked as the next target of a serial killer, Suema develops an unusual interest and knowledge in criminal and abnormal psychology, as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. Suema struggles to find acceptance among her peers at Shinyo Academy. They look upon her as weird and exclude her, as a result of her unusual interests, though she is friends with Kinoshita Kyoko. In Boogiepop and Others, Suema first hears the rumours about Boogiepop, but dismisses them as fantasy, although she investigates a possible sighting of the shinigami. After seeing Nagi Kirima interrogate Kinoshita, Suema searches for Kirima's house and tries to learn what she can from her. She comes to learn that Kirima was involved with stopping the serial killer who had been stalking her, but was surprised to hear the claim that it was Boogiepop who saved her. Their relationship remains distant, despite Suema's efforts to change this. In Boogiepop Phantom, Suema meets Touka Miyashita for the first time and they quickly become close friends. She is relatively unaware of events as they unfold, and is entirely focused on studying for her University entrance exams with Miyashita. Suema appreciates how she is so unconditionally accepting of her and looks out for her friend. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1, we learn that Suema and Niitoki Kei are on friendly terms. Suema is approached by Kotoe Kinukawa, who seeks her help in regard to her relative, Jin Asukai. Suema investigates him and realises that something unusual is happening. After seeing a sketch of Suiko Minahoshi in Asukai's office, she goes to the place where Minahoshi had died, only to meet Aya Orihata for the first time and encourage her to take pleasure in life and fulfill her goals. Suema repeatedly just misses learning about what is really going on in the city. Throughout her story, the major theme is how a childhood trauma can influence the growth of an individual. Her backstory, where Suema was stalked by the serial killer, is described in full detail in Boogiepop at Dawn."}

The final stage of this process can also involve manufacturing the finished product."], "answers": ["Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 7", "Paragraph 9"], "context": "Paragraph 1: Season of Flame received generally favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Steinberg of GameSpy praised the game's \"challenging and varied gameplay\" and \"colorful graphics\". Anise Hollingshead of GameZone, while criticizing the game's short length and the \"sameness\" of the minigames, said that it is \"a great game for everyone in the family\". Craig Harris of IGN and Frank Provo of GameSpot declared that the game was superior to its predecessor in a number of areas. Four-Eyed Dragon of GamePro cited the \"tricky controls\" as the only negative point of the game, saying that \"the digital directional pad doesn't allow for smooth diagonal movement, which Spyro does a lot in each world.\" Ben Kosmina of Nintendo World Report also found fault in the controls, stating that they have not improved from Spyro: Season of Ice and that it is \"still incredibly awkward trying to control him while gliding, as he'll go zooming off all over the place with the slightest touch.\" Game Informer, while concluding that exploring the worlds was enjoyable, said that \"the jumping portions of the game are still a little iffy, and I killed myself quite a lot from misreading the view\". Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame (\"All Game Guide\" at the time) cited that the graphics, humor and puzzles were \"engaging enough to warrant a purchase for devotees of the purple dragon\", but added that the game would benefit from better controls and more varied objectives. Nintendo Power noted that the game was presented in the same style and shown from the same isometric perspective as Spyro: Season of Ice. Martin Taylor of Eurogamer cited \"boredom\" as the game's major flaw, saying that nothing in the game \"really makes you want to carry on the story through to its end because none of it is particularly fun.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Just as they had been in 2010 under their former guise as  – when the team won two stages and the overall classification with Charteau – the team was very successful at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo in Africa. Gène took the team's first win of the year (and accordingly, first under their new name) in stage 2, the only stage that finished outside the race's primary host nation of Gabon, winning a field sprint in Ebolowa in Cameroon. In stage 4, the event's defending champion Charteau figured into a winning breakaway. Though he finished 24 seconds back on stage winner Daniel Teklehaymanot, he assumed the race leadership. He had a lead of four seconds over the man in second place and seven seconds over the man in third, but a good two minutes over the man in fourth, meaning it was virtually certain that he would at the very least finish on the podium. The next day, Gène added a second sprint win, as most of the field finished together and Charteau retained his advantage in the overall. While the final stage had the potential to shake up the overall standings, with three large groups finishing four seconds after one another, Charteau held on to win the race overall for the second straight year by finishing in the first of these groups. In February, at the Étoile de Bessèges, Haddou won the sprint finish to the race's titular stage finishing in Bessèges. Later in February, Voeckler won the first stage of the Tour Méditerranéen. He had instigated the morning breakaway with four others, and they stayed away by a margin of three seconds over the fast-charging peloton. Voeckler won the two-day Tour du Haut Var later in February. He finished one second down on Samuel Dumoulin in stage 1, but in the hillier second stage, he finished 29 seconds clear of any other riders, along with breakaway companion Julien Antomarchi. He allowed Antomarchi to take the stage win, knowing that he had the race overall won. The team entered another African race in February, the Tour of South Africa. After winning La Tropicale Amissa Bongo, Charteau was expected to be a top contender for victory, but he broke his collarbone after a stage 1 crash and had to leave the race. The squad did pick up a win, with Gène taking stage 3 from a breakaway sprint, but their best-placed overall finisher was Quemeneur over two minutes down on race champion Kristian House.\n\nParagraph 3: The first method of traverse is to rely entirely on movement along a curved section of track or on a turntable with no provision to traverse the gun on its mount. The second is to traverse the rail car body on its trucks, known as a car-traversing mount. Generally this is limited to a few degrees of traverse to either side unless an elaborate foundation is built with a centre pivot and traversing rollers. The design of the foundation is the only limit to the amount of traverse allowed in this latter case. The third choice is to allow the separate gun mount to rotate with respect to the rail car body, known as a top-carriage traversing mount. This usually requires the gun to be mounted on a central pivot which, in turn, is mounted on the car body. With few exceptions these types of mounts require some number of outriggers, stabilisers, or earth anchors to keep them in place against the recoil forces and are generally more suitable for smaller guns. The American post–World War I assessment of railway artillery considered that the utility of even a small amount of traverse for fine adjustments was high enough that either of the two latter traversing methods is preferable to a fixed mount.\n\nParagraph 4: The Sterntal Concentration Camp (, ) was located in Kidričevo. It was a central collection point for the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Slovenia (Ostsiedlung) after the Second World War. The roots of the camp go back to a prisoner of war camp from the First World War, later used as a refugee camp for people displaced by the Battles of the Isonzo. In 1941, following annexation, the German authorities () established a prisoner of war camp at the site to provide labor to build an aluminum smelter (the plant was not completed until 1947–1954, using forced labor by political prisoners from postwar camps). At the beginning of 1942, the camp contained 1,076 workers, 185 criminal internees, and 89 prisoners of war. In 1944, family members of deserters were also forced to work at the camp. In May 1945, under the direction of Aleksandar Ranković, the Yugoslav secret police (OZNA) established a concentration camp at the site to collect ethnic Germans from across Slovenia, especially from Lower Styria and Gottschee. Ethnic Hungarians from Prekmurje were also sent to the camp. Overcrowding and poor hygiene at the camp caused many of the inmates to die from amoebiasis and typhoid fever. The inmates were also physically and mentally tortured, and many were shot. Tortures included forcing the prisoners to lie on the ground while their captors rode motorcycles over them. The deaths included large numbers of the elderly and young children; some accounts state that no children under the age of two survived. The camp, which was designed to accommodate 2,000 people, contained between 8,000 and 12,000 prisoners. Up to 5,000 people died at the camp. The Sterntal Concentration Camp was closed down in October 1945 through the efforts of the Red Cross, and most of the survivors were sent to Austria.\n\nParagraph 5: Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s that experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backward tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment.  His nineteen-minute \"The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party\" \"anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings\". Other songs from Fahey's The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party & Other Excursions (recorded between 1962 and 1966) also used \"unsettling moods and dissonances\" that took them beyond the typical folk fare. In 1967, he performed with the psychedelic/avant-garde/noise rock band Red Krayola (then Red Crayola) at the Berkeley Folk Festival which was recorded and later released as Live 1967.  Among other descriptions, their performance has been likened to early Velvet Underground bootlegs and \"the very weirdest parts of late-'60s Pink Floyd pieces (like the shrieking guitar scrapes of 'Interstellar Overdrive')\".\n\nParagraph 6: After this, the freeway ends and US 40 resumes along the one-way pair of West Mulberry Street eastbound and West Franklin Street westbound, carrying three lanes in each direction. The route intersects the northern terminus of MD 295, which is routed along the one-way pair of North Paca Street northbound and North Greene Street southbound, and the southern terminus of MD 129, which is routed along the one-way pair of North Paca Street northbound and Pennsylvania Avenue southbound. From here, US 40 passes south of the Seton Hill Historic District as it heads into the Mount Vernon neighborhood north of downtown Baltimore and continues east, crossing MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink at North Howard Street. The route crosses North Charles Street, at which point the name changes to East Mulberry Street eastbound and East Franklin Street westbound. US 40 intersects the southbound direction of MD 2 at St. Paul Street before both directions rejoin along Orleans Street, a six-lane undivided road. The route heads onto the Orleans Street Viaduct, passing over the northbound direction of MD 2 (North Calvert Street) and I-83 (with no access) in the Jones Falls stream valley. After this, the road becomes a divided highway and runs through urban areas of homes and businesses in East Baltimore, heading south of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School before passing through the campus of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Past the hospital, US 40 becomes a four-lane undivided road and continues past rowhomes and some businesses. Farther east, the route intersects Pulaski Highway and heads east-northeast along four-lane undivided Pulaski Highway, passing through commercial areas with some urban homes. The road intersects the western terminus of MD 150 at Haven Street before it passes under an abandoned railroad line and then Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The route continues through industrial areas and passes under CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision railroad line before it widens to a six-lane divided highway and reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 151 (Erdman Avenue) and the eastern terminus of US 40 Truck that also includes a ramp to southbound I-895 accessible from eastbound US 40. A short distance later, US 40 crosses I-895, with a ramp from northbound I-895 to eastbound US 40. The road continues northeast through commercial areas and comes to a partial interchange with Moravia Road, with no eastbound entrance. Past this, US 40 reaches a partial interchange with I-95, with a ramp from westbound US 40 to southbound I-95 and a ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound US 40; the missing movements are provided via Moravia Road and I-895.\n\nParagraph 7: Mitchell had not kept a catalogue of his collection, and as a result, cataloguing was an early priority for librarians in the Mitchell Library. A research department was established as part of the public library in the 1920s under the direction of Nita Kibble, while Ida Leeson as Head of Acquisitions researched gaps in the library's collections. Kibble's research department was later used as a model by other State Libraries when establishing similar services. Mitchell's bequest also included funding for collection acquisition; expanding the library's collection (particularly in the area of Australiana and Pacific material) was a priority for both Wright and William Ifould, who was appointed Principal Librarian in 1912. Ifould envisioned the library as a repository of material relating to the history of Australia, not just New South Wales, and led efforts to collect material. The library acquired the papers of Lachlan Macquarie and his family in 1914, Matthew Flinders in 1922, and Abel Tasman's journal in 1926, and after World War I collected journals of soldiers from that conflict. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Library (now the National Library of Australia), established in 1901, was also collecting Australiana material. This led to conflict over the acquisition of the papers of James Cook, which were offered at auction in London in 1923. The Trustees chose not to bid for the papers as doing so would have limited the library's Australiana acquisitions budget for several years and Ifould, already in London with hopes of purchasing the papers for the Mitchell Library, was directed instead to purchase them on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library and the Public Library of New South Wales using funds provided by the Federal Government.\n\nParagraph 8: Along with frogs and earthworms, fetal pigs are among the most common animals used in classroom dissection. There are several reasons for this, the main reason being that pigs, like humans, are mammals. Shared traits include common hair, mammary glands, live birth, similar organ systems, metabolic levels, and basic body form.  They also allow for the study of fetal circulation, which differs from that of an adult. Secondly, fetal pigs are easy to obtain because they are by-products of the pork industry. Fetal pigs are the unborn piglets of sows that were killed by the meat-packing industry. These pigs are not bred and killed for this purpose, but are extracted from the deceased sow’s uterus. Fetal pigs not used in classroom dissections are often used in fertilizer or simply discarded. Thirdly, fetal pigs are cheap, which is an essential component for dissection use by schools. They can be ordered for about $30 at biological product companies. Fourthly, fetal pigs are easy to dissect because of their soft tissue and incompletely developed bones that are still made of cartilage. In addition, they are relatively large with well-developed organs that are easily visible. As long as the pork industry exists, fetal pigs will be relatively abundant, making them the prime choice for classroom dissections.\n\nParagraph 9: Third, the voids are gradually filled by forcing a carbon-forming gas such as acetylene through the material at a high temperature, over the course of several days. This long heat treatment process also allows the carbon to form into larger graphite crystals, and is the major reason for the material's high cost. The gray \"Reinforced Carbon–Carbon (RCC)\" panels on the space shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cone cost NASA $100,000/sq ft to produce, although much of this cost was a result of the advanced geometry and research costs associated with the panels. This stage can also include manufacturing of the finished product.\n\nParagraph 10: After the opening of the Leeds to Manchester line, only the gap between the M&LR's Oldham Road station and the L&MR's Liverpool Road terminus in Manchester, prevented there being a through line from Liverpool to Hull.  As well as the inconvenience to passengers, goods had to be unloaded and carted across Manchester and reloaded into railway wagons. The companies agreed to make a connecting line from the M&LR at Miles Platting to a new station at Hunt's Bank and on to the terminus of the Manchester and Bolton Railway (close to the present-day Salford Central station) and over an ‘S’-shaped link to join the L&MR to the west of its terminus in July 1838. The Hunt's Bank site was purchased privately by Samuel Brooks, vice-chairman of the M&LR, and presented to the company in August 1838. The section from Miles Platting to Hunt's Bank was built by the M&LR, and the western section by the L&MR. The Royal Assent was given to an L&MR Act for this arrangement on 14 June 1839, followed by an M&LR Act on 1 July, which also authorised branches to Oldham and Halifax. There was considerable controversy because a southern route was strongly advocated; the L&MR in particular was attracted to a connection to the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, giving better connections southwards, at the cost of failing to connect the Bolton line at all, and of requiring some form of transshipment for Leeds traffic, because of incompatibility in the levels. It took some time to pacify the dissenters, but a new L&MR Act was obtained on 30 July 1839, finalising the matter."}
