GPQA Diamond Dataset Handler

GPQA Diamond is a high-quality subset of GPQA containing the most
challenging and well-vetted graduate-level science questions.

Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Idavidrein/gpqa (config: gpqa_diamond)

The format is identical to the main GPQA dataset, so we reuse the same
formatter and evaluator.
